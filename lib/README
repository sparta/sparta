This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
SPARTA, if particular packages are included in the SPARTA build.

Most of these directories contain code for the library; some contain a
Makefile.sparta file that points to where the library is installed
elsewhere on your system.

In either case, the library itself must be installed and/or built
first, so that the appropriate library files exist for SPARTA to link
against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

To build the COUPLE package, please download LAMMPS into this folder.
See the "fix lammps" doc page for more information.

The libraries in this directory are the following:

kokkos        Kokkos package for GPU and many-core acceleration
                from Kokkos development team (Sandia)
python        hooks to the system Python library, used by the PYTHON package
                from the SPARTA development team
