This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
SPARTA, if particular packages are included in the SPARTA build.

Most of these directories contain code for the library; some contain a
Makefile.sparta file that points to where the library is installed
elsewhere on your system.

In either case, the library itself must be installed and/or built
first, so that the appropriate library files exist for SPARTA to link
against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.  This may require you to edit
one of the provided Makefiles to make it suitable for your machine.

The libraries in this directory are the following:

kokkos        Kokkos package for GPU and many-core acceleration
                from Kokkos development team (Sandia)
