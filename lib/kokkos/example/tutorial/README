Build the examples by typing in each directory: 
make -j 16

To specify a target device:
KOKKOS_DEVICES=OpenMP  make -j 16
KOKKOS_DEVICES=Pthread make -j 16
KOKKOS_DEVICES=Serial  make -j 16
KOKKOS_DEVICES=Cuda    make -j 16

Some of the advanced topics try to highlight performance impacts by timing 
different variants of doing the same thing.
