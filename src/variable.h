/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: World variable count doesn't match # of partitions

A world-style variable must specify a number of values equal to the
number of processor partitions.

E: Universe/uloop variable count < # of partitions

A universe or uloop style variable must specify a number of values >= to the
number of processor partitions.

E: All universe/uloop variables must have same # of values

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot redefine variable as a different style

An equal-style variable can be re-defined but only if it was
originally an equal-style variable.

E: File variable could not read value

Check the file assigned to the variable.

E: Grid-style variables are not yet implemented

Self-explanatory.

E: Surf-style variables are not yet implemented

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable name must be alphanumeric or underscore characters

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid variable in next command

Self-explanatory.

E: All variables in next command must be same style

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid variable style with next command

Variable styles {equal} and {world} cannot be used in a next
command.

E: Next command must list all universe and uloop variables

This is to insure they stay in sync.

E: Variable has circular dependency

A circular dependency is when variable "a" in used by variable "b" and
variable "b" is also used by varaible "a".  Circular dependencies with
longer chains of dependence are also not allowed.

E: Invalid syntax in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable evaluation before simulation box is defined

Cannot evaluate a compute or fix or atom-based value in a variable
before the simulation has been setup.

E: Invalid compute ID in variable formula

The compute is not recognized.

E: Compute used in variable between runs is not current

Computes cannot be invoked by a variable in between runs.  Thus they
must have been evaluated on the last timestep of the previous run in
order for their value(s) to be accessed.  See the doc page for the
variable command for more info.

E: Variable formula compute vector is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable formula compute array is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Per-particle compute in equal-style variable formula

Equal-style variables cannot use per-particle quantities.

E: Mismatched compute in variable formula

A compute is referenced incorrectly or a compute that produces per-atom
values is used in an equal-style variable formula.

E: Invalid fix ID in variable formula

The fix is not recognized.

E: Fix in variable not computed at compatible time

Fixes generate their values on specific timesteps.  The variable is
requesting the values on a non-allowed timestep.

E: Variable formula fix vector is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable formula fix array is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Per-particle fix in equal-style variable formula

Equal-style variables cannot use per-particle quantities.

E: Mismatched fix in variable formula

A fix is referenced incorrectly or a fix that produces per-atom
values is used in an equal-style variable formula.

E: Invalid variable name in variable formula

Variable name is not recognized.

E: Invalid variable evaluation in variable formula

A variable used in a formula could not be evaluated.

E: Particle-style variable in equal-style variable formula

Equal-style variables cannot use per-particle quantities.

E: Mismatched variable in variable formula

A variable is referenced incorrectly or an atom-style variable that
produces per-atom values is used in an equal-style variable
formula.

E: Invalid math/special function in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Too many particles per processor for particle-style variable

The number of particles per MPI rank is too large, increase the
number of MPI ranks.

E: Too many grid cells per processor for grid-style variable

The number of grid cells per MPI rank is too large, increase the
number of MPI ranks.

E: Invalid stats keyword in variable formula

The keyword is not recognized.

E: Divide by 0 in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Modulo 0 in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Power by 0 in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Sqrt of negative value in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Log of zero/negative value in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Arcsin of invalid value in variable formula

Argument of arcsin() must be between -1 and 1.

E: Arccos of invalid value in variable formula

Argument of arccos() must be between -1 and 1.

E: Invalid math function in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable name between brackets must be alphanumeric or underscore characters

Self-explanatory.

E: Non digit character between brackets in variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Mismatched brackets in variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Empty brackets in variable

There is no variable syntax that uses empty brackets.  Check
the variable doc page.

E: Index between variable brackets must be positive

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use ramp in variable formula between runs

This is because the ramp() function is time dependent.

E: Cannot use vdisplace in variable formula between runs

This is a function of elapsed time.

E: Cannot use swiggle in variable formula between runs

This is a function of elapsed time.

E: Cannot use cwiggle in variable formula between runs

This is a function of elapsed time.

E: Invalid special function in variable formula

Self-explanatory.

E: Variable ID in variable formula does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid variable style in special function next

Only file-style or atomfile-style variables can be used with next().

E: Particle vector in equal-style variable formula

Equal-style variables cannot use per-particle quantities.

E: Invalid Boolean syntax in if command

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot open file variable file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct.
