/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot read grid before simulation box is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot read grid when grid is already defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Read_grid did not find parents section of grid file

Expected Parents section but did not find keyword.

E: Incorrect format of parent cell in grid file

Number of words in a parent cell line was not the expected number.

E: Invalid cell ID in grid file

A cell ID could not be converted into numeric format.

E: Duplicate cell ID in grid file

Parent cell IDs must be unique.

E: Parent cell's parent does not exist in grid file

Parent cells must be listed in order such that
each cell's parents have already appeared in the list.

E: Invalid Nx,Ny,Nz values in grid file

A Nx or Ny or Nz value for a parent cell is <= 0.

E: Nz value in read_grid file must be 1 for a 2d simulation

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot open gzipped file

SPARTA was compiled without support for reading and writing gzipped
files through a pipeline to the gzip program with -DSPARTA_GZIP.

E: Cannot open file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct. If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.

E: Unexpected end of grid file

Self-explanatory.

E: Grid file does not contain parents

No parent cells appeared in the grid file.
