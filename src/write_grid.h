/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot write grid when grid is not defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Cannot open file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct. If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.
