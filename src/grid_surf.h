/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Too many surfs in one cell

Use the global surfmax command to increase this max allowed number of
surfs per grid cell.

E: Inconsistent surface to grid mapping in read_restart

When surface elements were mapped to grid cells after reading a
restart file, an inconsitent count of elements in a grid cell was
found, as compared to the original simulation, which should not
happen.  Please report the issue to the SPARTA developers.
