/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: React tce can only be used with collide vss

Self-explanatory.

E: Ionization and recombination reactions are not yet implemented

This error conditions will be removed after those reaction styles are
fully implemented.

E: Unknown outcome in reaction

The specified type of the reaction is not encoded in the reaction
style.

E: Cannot open reaction file %s

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid reaction formula in file

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid reaction type in file

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid reaction style in file

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid reaction coefficients in file

Self-explanatory.
