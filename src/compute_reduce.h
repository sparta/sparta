/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Compute reduce replace requires min or max mode

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid replace values in compute reduce

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute ID for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-particle vector

This is necessary if no column index is used to specify the compute.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-particle array

This is necessary if a column index is used to specify the compute.

E: Compute reduce compute array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-grid vector

This is necessary if no column index is used to specify the compute.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-grid array

This is necessary if a column index is used to specify the compute.

E: Compute reduce compute calculates global or surf values

The compute reduce command does not operate on this kind of values.
The variable command has special functions that can reduce global
values.

E: Fix ID for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-particle vector

This is necessary if no column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-particle array

This is necessary if a column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-grid vector

This is necessary if no column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-grid array

This is necessary if a column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-surf vector

This is necessary if no column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-surf array

This is necessary if a column index is used to specify the fix.

E: Compute reduce fix calculates global values

A fix that calculates peratom or local values is required.

E: Variable name for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce variable is not particle-style variable

This is the only style of variable that can be reduced.

E: Fix used in compute reduce not computed at compatible time

Fixes generate their values on specific timesteps.  Compute reduce is
requesting a value on a non-allowed timestep.
