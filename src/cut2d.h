/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Point appears first in more than one CLINE

SPARTA developers.

E: Point appears last in more than one CLINE

This is an error when calculating how a 2d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Singlet CLINES point not on cell border

This is an error when calculating how a 2d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: No positive areas in cell

This is an error when calculating how a 2d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: More than one positive area with a negative area

SPARTA cannot determine which positive area the negative area is
inside of, if a cell is so large that it includes both positive and
negative areas.

E: Single area is negative, inverse donut

An inverse donut is a surface with a flow region interior to the donut
hole and also exterior to the entire donut.  This means the flow
regions are disconnected.  SPARTA cannot correctly compute the flow
area of this kind of object.

E: Could not find split point in split cell

This is an error when calculating how a grid cell is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.
