/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Cannot read_restart after simulation box is defined

The read_restart command cannot be used after a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Cannot (yet) use global mem/limit without % in restart file name

This feature is not yet implemented.

E: Cannot open restart file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct.  If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.

E: Invalid flag in peratom section of restart file

The format of this section of the file is not correct.

E: Did not assign all restart unsplit grid cells correctly

One or more unsplit grid cells in the restart file were not assigned
to a processor.  Please report the issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Did not assign all restart split grid cells correctly

One or more split grid cells in the restart file were not assigned
to a processor.  Please report the issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Did not assign all restart sub grid cells correctly

One or more sub grid cells in the restart file were not assigned to a
processor.  Please report the issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Did not assign all restart particles correctly

One or more particles in the restart file were not assigned to a
processor.  Please report the issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Cannot open dir to search for restart file

Using a "*" in the name of the restart file will open the current
directory to search for matching file names.

E: Found no restart file matching pattern

When using a "*" in the restart file name, no matching file was found.

E: Restart file incompatible with current version

This is probably because you are trying to read a file created with a
version of SPARTA that is too old compared to the current version.

E: Smallint setting in spatype.h is not compatible

Smallint size stored in restart file is not consistent with SPARTA
version you are running.

E: Cellint setting in spatype.h is not compatible

Cellint size stored in restart file is not consistent with SPARTA
version you are running.

E: Bigint setting in spatype.h is not compatible

Bigint size stored in restart file is not consistent with SPARTA
version you are running.

W: Restart file used different # of processors

The restart file was written out by a SPARTA simulation running on a
different number of processors.  This means you will likely want to
re-balance the grid cells and particles across processors.  This can
be done using the balance or fix balance commands.

E: Invalid flag in header section of restart file

Unrecognized entry in restart file.

E: Invalid flag in particle section of restart file

Unrecognized entry in restart file.

E: Invalid flag in grid section of restart file

Unrecognized entry in restart file.

E: Invalid flag in surf section of restart file

Unrecognized entry in restart file.

E: Restart file is not a multi-proc file

The file is inconsistent with the filename specified for it.

E: Restart file is a multi-proc file

The file is inconsistent with the filename specified for it.

E: Invalid flag in layout section of restart file

Unrecognized entry in restart file.

E: Invalid SPARTA restart file

The file does not appear to be a SPARTA restart file since it does not
have the expected magic string at the beginning.

E: Restart file byte ordering is swapped

The file was written on a machine with different byte-ordering than
the machine you are reading it on.

E: Restart file byte ordering is not recognized

The file does not appear to be a SPARTA restart file since it doesn't
contain a recognized byte-ordering flag at the beginning.
