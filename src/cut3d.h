/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Singlet BPG edge not on cell face

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: BPG edge on more than 2 faces

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Vertex has less than 3 edges

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Vertex contains invalid edge

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Vertex contains edge that doesn't point to it

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Vertex contains duplicate edge

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Vertex pointers to last edge are invalid

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Edge not part of 2 vertices

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Edge part of same vertex twice

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Edge part of invalid vertex

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: No positive volumes in cell

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: More than one positive volume with a negative volume

SPARTA cannot determine which positive volume the negative volume is
inside of, if a cell is so large that it includes both positive and
negative volumes.

E: Single volume is negative, inverse donut

An inverse donut is a surface with a flow region interior to the donut
hole and also exterior to the entire donut.  This means the flow
regions are disconnected.  SPARTA cannot correctly compute the flow
volume of this kind of object.

E: Could not find split point in split cell

This is an error when calculating how a grid cell is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.

E: Found edge in same direction

This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
surface elements.  It should not normally occur.  Please report the
issue to the SPARTA developers.
