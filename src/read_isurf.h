/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot read_surf before grid is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot read_surf before grid ghost cells are defined

This needs to be documented if keep this restriction.

E: Cannot read_surf after particles are defined

This is because the newly read surface objects may enclose particles.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Invalid reuse of surface ID in read_surf command

Surface IDs must be unique.

E: Read_surf did not find points section of surf file

Expected Parents section but did not find keyword.

E: Read_surf did not find lines section of surf file

Expected Lines section but did not find keyword.

E: Read_surf did not find triangles section of surf file

Expected Triangles section but did not find keyword.

E: Invalid read_surf command

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid read_surf geometry transformation for 2d simulation

Cannot perform a transformation that changes z cooridinates of points
for a 2d simulation.

E: Unexpected end of data file

SPARTA hit the end of the data file while attempting to read a
section.  Something is wrong with the format of the data file.

E: Surf file cannot contain lines for 3d simulation

Self-explanatory.

E: Surf file cannot contain triangles for 2d simulation

Self-explanatory.

E: Surf file does not contain points

Self-explanatory.

E: Surf file does not contain lines

Required for a 2d simulation.

E: Surf file does not contain triangles

Required for a 3d simulation.

E: Unexpected end of surf file

Self-explanatory.

E: Incorrect point format in surf file

Self-explanatory.

E: Incorrect line format in surf file

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid point index in line

Self-explanatory.

E: Incorrect triangle format in surf file

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid point index in triangle

Self-explanatory.

E: %d read_surf points are not inside simulation box

If clipping was not performed, all points in surf file
must be inside (or on surface of) simulation box.

E: Surface check failed with %d duplicate points

One or more points appeared in more than 2 lines.

E: Surface check failed with %d unmatched points

One or more points did not appear in a line, or appeared only once and
point is not on surface of simulation box.

E: Surface check failed with %d duplicate edges

One or more edges appeared in more than 2 triangles.

E: Surface check failed with %d unmatched edges

One or more edges did not appear in a triangle, or appeared only once
and edge is not on surface of simulation box.

E: Surface check failed with %d infinitely thin line pairs

Two adjacent lines have normals in opposite directions
indicating the lines overlay each other.

W: Surface check found %d nearly infinitely thin line pairs

Two adjacent lines have normals in nearly opposite directions
indicating the lines nearly overlay each other.

E: Surface check failed with %d infinitely thin triangle pairs

Two adjacent triangles have normals in opposite directions indicating
the triangles overlay each other.

W: Surface check found %d nearly infinitely thin triangle pairs

Two adjacent triangles have normals in nearly opposite directions
indicating the triangles nearly overlay each other.

E: Surface check failed with %d points on lines

One or more points are on a line they are not an end point of, which
indicates an ill-formed surface.

W: Surface check found %d points nearly on lines

One or more points are nearly on a line they are not an end point of,
which indicates an ill-formed surface.

E: Surface check failed with %d points on triangles

One or more points are on a triangle they are not an end point of,
which indicates an ill-formed surface.

W: Surface check found %d points nearly on triangles

One or more points are nearly on a triangle they are not an end point
of, which indicates an ill-formed surface.

E: Cannot open gzipped file

SPARTA was compiled without support for reading and writing gzipped
files through a pipeline to the gzip program with -DSPARTA_GZIP.

E: Cannot open file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct. If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.

E: %d read_surf point pairs are too close

A pair of points is very close together, relative to grid size,
inidicating the grid is too large, or an ill-formed surface.
