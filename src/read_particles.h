/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot create particles before simulation box is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot create particles before grid is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.

E: Create_particles mixture ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Create_particles species ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Create_particles global option not yet implemented

Self-explanatory.

E: Created incorrect # of particles: %ld versus %ld

The create_particles command did not function
properly.

E: Create_particles single requires z = 0 for 2d simulation

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not create a single particle

The specified position was either not inside the simulation domain or
not inside a grid cell with no intersections with any defined surface
elements.
