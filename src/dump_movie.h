/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Invalid dump movie filename

The file produced by dump movie cannot be binary or compressed
and must be a single file for a single processor.

E: Support for writing movies not included

SPARTA was not built with the -DSPARTA_FFMPEG switch in the Makefile

E: Failed to open FFmpeg pipeline to file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct and writable and that the FFmpeg executable can be found and run.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPARTA to see the offending line.
