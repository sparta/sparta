To see movies of ablation occurring, uncomment the block of dump image
and dump_modify lines in either of the input scripts.  Running each on
more processors and for several 100 or 1000 steps will give longer,
better movies (see comments in input files).  You can make a movie
with the ImageMagick convert command as follows:

% convert binary*ppm movie.gif

Then load movie.gif as a file into your browser to see it animated.

In 2d, the colors represent clumps of grid cells owned by each
processor.  In 3d, the colors represent surface elements owned by each
processor.
