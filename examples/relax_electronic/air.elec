# This is not a complete set of states and the collision numbers are arbitrary
# However it is made to show the various functionality.
# Without electrons in the mixture, Only the ground and a1Sigma states would be populated
# In electron impact processes, transitions can occur from singlet to triplet states, which
# then allows the triplet states to be populated as well
