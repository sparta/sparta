There are two inputs which demonstrate an explicit surface being
converted to an implicit surface. Optionally, an image of each surface
can also be rendered by uncommenting the "dump image" and "dump
modify" commands in the inputs. In the images, the outline of the
surface is in grey. The particles are also drawn in the 2D case but
not in the 3D case.

1) The in.exp2imp.circle.2d input is a 2D circle which is converted to 
   an implicit surface.
2) The in.exp2imp.sphere.3d input is a 3D sphere which is converted to 
   an implicit surface
