These input scripts demonstrate use of these 4 computes which
tally gas and surface collisions and reactions and
allow them to be dumped via dump tally:

compute gas/collision/tally
compute gas/reaction/tally
compute surf/collision/tally
compute surf/reaction/tally

Each produces a dump file via the dump tally command which tallies
information about the collisions and reactions.
