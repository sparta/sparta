## src

* Files related to a new compute momentum command, and two new fixes: `fix_emit_surf_timeavg` and `fix_emit_surf_mflow`.
* The two fixes are based on `fix_emit_surf` of the SPARTA vanilla implementation, which is included in the path for easy comparision.
* MAKE/Makefile.kokkos_mpi_only: `SPARTA_INC = -DSPARTA_GZIP â€“DSPARTA_BIGBIG`. The BIGBIG flag is added.

## tests

* Two test directories `surf_mflow_test` and `surf_timeavg_test` for testing the two new fixes
* Input files and submission (to PBS scheduler) files included

## tools

* minor bugfixes made in `log2txt.py` and  `pizza/olog.py`
