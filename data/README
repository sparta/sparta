This directory contains various kinds of input data files for SPARTA.
You can add your own files to this directory, using the existing files
as templates to get the format correct.  Or you can copy these into
the directory where your input script is and modify them as you wish.

Files that end in ".species" contain thermophysical properties of
chemical species and are read by the species command.

Files that end in ".species.vib" contain additional info about the
vibrational modes of polyatomic chemcial species.  They are read by
the species command via its "vibfile" option.

Files that end in ".vss" or ".vhs" or ".hs" contain collision model
parameters that can be for the variable soft sphere (VSS) or variable
hard sphere (vhs) or hard-sphere (HS) models.  These are read by the
collide command.

Files that end in ".tce" list reactions gas-phase chemistry for the
Total Collision Energy (TCE) model and are read by the react command.

Files that start with "sdata." contain lists of surface elements and
are read by the read_surf command.

Files that end in ".stl" are STL-formatted surface files which can be
converted to SPARTA formatted surface files via the stl2surf.py tool
in the tools directory.

Files that end in ".surf" list reactions for surface chemistry
and are read by the surf_react command.

These are the doc pages for various commands which describe the format
of the corresponding files:

species = doc/species.html
species.vib = doc/species.html
vss/vhs/hs = doc/collide.html
tce = doc/react.html
sdata = doc/read_surf.html
stl = doc/Section_tools.html#stl2surf
surf = doc/surf_react.html
