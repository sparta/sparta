move_surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

move_surf groupID style args ... keyword value ... :pre

group-ID = group ID for which surface elements to move :ulb,l
style = {file} or {trans} or {rotate} :l
  {file} args = filename entry
  {trans} args = Dx Dy Dz
    Dx,Dy,Dz = displacement applied to all surface points (distance units)
  {rotate} args = theta Rx Ry Rz Ox Oy Oz 
    theta = rotate surface points by this angle in counter-clockwise direction (degrees)
    Rx,Ry,Rz = rotate around vector starting at origin pointing in this direction
    Ox,Oy,Oz = origin to rotate around (distance units) :pre
zero  or more keyword/value pairs may be appended  :l
keyword = {connect} :l
  connect arg = yes or no :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

move_surf all trans 1 0 0
move_surf partial rotate 360 0 0 1 5 5 0 connect yes
move_surf object2 rotate 360 0 0 1 5 5 0 :pre

[Description:]

This command performs a one-time movement of all the surface elements
in the specified group via the specified style.  See the "group
surf"_group.html command for info on how surface elements can be
assigned to surface groups.

This command can be invoked as many times as desired, before or
between simulation runs.  Surface points can also be moved on-the-fly
during a simulation by using the "fix move/surf"_fix_move_surf.html
command.

Moving surfaces between simulations can be useful if you want to
perform a series of runs from one input script, where some attribute
of the surface elements change, e.g. the separation between two
spheres.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The {file} style is not yet implemented.  It will
allow new positions of points to be listed in a file.

In 2d, surface elements are line segments with 2 vertices each.  In
3d, surface elements are triangles with 3 vertices each.  If a line
segment or triangle belongs to the specified group, all of its
vertices are moved.  This effectively moves the entire surface
element.  

IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless a vertex is on the simulation box boundary, it
will be part of two surface elements (in 2d) or multiple surface
elements (in 3d).  If you choose a surface groupID which does not
include all the elements in a gridded object, then you cannot move
them without breaking apart the object in a "watertight" sense (so
that particles could erroneously move inside the object).  To prevent
this use the optional {connect} keyword with its {yes} setting.  This
will insure that multiple copies of the same vertex in other elements
(not in the surface group) will also be moved.  This is a way to morph
the shape of a gridded object, e.g. make a sphere more oblate, by
moving only a portion of its elements.

The {trans} style shifts or displaces each vertex by the vector
(Dx,Dy,Dz).

The {rotate} style rotates the coordinates of all vertices by an angle
{theta} in a counter-clockwise direction, around the vector starting
at (Ox,Oy,Oz) and pointing in the direction {Rx,Ry,Rz}.  Any desired
rotation can be represented by an appropriate choice of (Ox,Oy,Oz),
{theta}, and (Rx,Ry,Rz).

After the surface has been moved, then all particles in grid cells
that meet either of these criteria are deleted:

the grid cell is now inside a surface
the grid cell overlaps with a surface element that moved :ul

This is to prevent particles from ending up inside surface objects.

Note that in this context, "overlaps" means that any part of the
surface element touches any part of the grid cell, including its
surface.  Also note that if a surface element object (e.g. a sphere)
moved a long distance then grid cells that were inside the object in
its old position and thus contained no particles, will still have no
particles immediately after the move.  This will effectively leave a
"void" in the flow until particles re-fill the grid cells that are now
outside the object.

[Restrictions:]

An error will be generated if any surface element vertex is moved
outside the simulation box.
