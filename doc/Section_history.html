<H3>13. Future and history

<P>This section lists features we are planning to add to SPARTA, features
of previous versions of SPARTA, and features of other parallel
molecular dynamics codes I've distributed.

<P>The <A HREF = "https://sparta.github.io/future.html<A HREF = "https://sparta.github.io/authors.html">developers</A>">>wish list link</A> on the
SPARTA web page gives a list of features we are planning to add to
SPARTA in the future.  Please contact the
<A HREF = </A> you are interested
in contributing to the those developments or would be a future user of
that feature.
</P>
<P>You can also send <A HREF = "https://sparta.github.io/authors.html">email to the
developers</A> if you want to add
your wish to the list.

<P>Sandia's predecessor to SPARTA is a DSMC code called ICARUS.  It was
developed in the early 1990s by Tim Bartel and <A HREF = "https://sjplimp.github.io">Steve
Plimpton</A>.  It was later modified and
extended by Michael Gallis.
</P>
<P>ICARUS is a 2d code, written in Fortran, which models the flow
geometry around bodies with a collection of adjoining body-fitted grid
blocks.  The geometry of the grid cells within in a single block is
represented with analytic equations, which allows for fast particle
tracking.
</P>
<P>Some details about ICARUS, including simulation snapshots and papers,
are discussed on <A HREF = "http://sjplimp.github.io/dsmc.html">this page</A>
</P>
<P>Performance-wise ICARUS scaled quite well on several generations of
parallel machines, and is still used by Sandia researchers today.
ICARUS was export-controlled software, and so was not distributed
widely outside of Sandia.
</P>
<P>SPARTA development began in late 2011.  In contrast to ICARUS, it is a
3d code, written in C++, and uses a hierarchical Cartesian grid to
track particles.  Surfaces are embedded in the grid, which cuts and
splits their flow volumes.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "https://sparta.github.io/history.html">Authors link</A> on the SPARTA
web page gives a timeline of features added to the code since it's
initial open-source release.
