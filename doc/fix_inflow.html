<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles into the simulation box continuously during a
simulation.  The particles are inserted at the specified faces using
properties of the specified mixture.  If done every timestep, this has
the effect of a continuous influx of particles thru the face(s).
</P>
<P>The properties of the inserted particles are from the mixture with ID
<I>mix-ID</I>.  This determines what particle species are in the mixture at
what relative fractions, and its number density, streaming velocity,
and temperature.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>One or more faces of the simulation box can be specified via the
<I>face1</I>, <I>face2</I>, etc arguments.  There are 6 individual faces that
can be specified as <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>, or <I>zhi</I>.
Specifying <I>all</I> is the same as specifying all 6 individual faces.
</P>
<P>On each insertion timestep, each cell with a face(s) adjacent to an
inflow boundary performs the following computation at the beginning of
the DSMC timestep.
</P>
<P>The number of particles <I>M</I> to be inserted on the
face is calculated, which is a function of the global <I>Fnum</I> value,
the mixture number density, the mixture streaming velocity and thermal
temperature, the area of the face, and its orientation relative to the
streaming velocity.
</P>
<P>If <I>M</I> has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will be
inserted, and a 13th depending on the outcome of a random number
generation.  Each particle will be inserted at a random location on
the face.  The particle species will be chosen randomly in accord with
the <I>frac</I> settings of the collection of species in the mixture, as
set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  The velocity of the
particle will be set to the sum of the streaming velocity of the
mixture and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature of
the mixture.  Both the streaming velocity and thermal temperature are
also set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>If the final particle velocity is not "into" the grid cell, then the
velocity sampling is repeated until it is.  This insures that <I>M</I>
particles enter the simulation domain as desired.
</P>
<P>The first timestep that inserted particles are advected, they move for
a random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow
field of particles enters the simulation box through that face.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> keyword can be useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>Np</I> is set
to 0, then the count of inserted particles is a function of the <I>Fnum</I>
and <I>nrho</I> and other mixture settings, as described above.  If <I>Np</I> is
set to a value > 0, then the <I>Fnum</I> and <I>nrho</I> settings are ignored,
and <I>Np</I> particles are inserted.  This is done by dividing <I>Np</I> by the
total number of grid cells that are adjacent to the specified box
faces and inserting an equal number of particles per grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are inserted.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this will give non-continuous, clumpy behavior in the
inlet flow field.
</P>
<P>The <I>perspecies</I> keyword determines how the species of each inserted
particle is randomly determined.  It has an effect on the statistical
properties of the inserted particles.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then a target insertion number <I>M</I> is
calculated for each species in a grid cell, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture
nfrac</A> command.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be inserted,
and a 13th depending on the outcome of a randomly generated number.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then a single target insertion number
<I>M</I> is calculated for all the species in a grid cell.  Each time a
particle is inserted, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the outcome of a randomly generated number.
</P>
<P>Here is a simple example, illustrating the difference between the two
options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative number
fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell inserts 10 particles
from that mixture.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then exactly 5
particles of each species will be inserted on every timestep
insertions take place.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then exactly
10 particles will be inserted every time and on average the insertion
will be 5 particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep
it might be 6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep
it might be 3 of the first and 7 of the second.

</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles inserted on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number inserted since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Particles cannot be inserted on <I>z</I> faces of the simluation box for a
2d simulation.  Particles cannot be inserted on periodic faces of the
simulation box.
</P>
<P>A <I>n</I> setting of <I>Np</I> > 0 can only be used with a <I>perspecies</I> setting
of <I>no</I>.
