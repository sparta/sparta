</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Use one or more per-surf vectors as inputs every few timesteps, and
average them surface element by surface element by over longer
timescales, applying appropriate normalization factors. The resulting
per-surf averages can be used by other output commands such as the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each input value can be a standard surface element attribute or can be
the result of a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> or the
evaluation of a surf-style <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.  In the latter
cases, the compute, fix, or variable must produce a per-surf vector,
not a global quantity or per-molecule quantity.  If you wish to
time-average global quantities from a compute, fix, or variable, then
see the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A> command.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "compute.html">Computes</A> that produce per-surf vectors or arrays are
those which have the word <I>surf</I> in their style name.  See the doc
pages for individual <A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A> to determine which ones produce
per-surf vectors or arrays.  <A HREF = "variable.html">Variables</A> of style <I>surf</I>
are the only ones that can be used with this fix since they produce
per-surf vectors.
</P>
<P>Each per-surf value of each input vector is averaged independently.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>Nevery</I>, <I>Nrepeat</I>, and <I>Nfreq</I> arguments specify on what
timesteps the input values will be used in order to contribute to the
average.  The final averaged quantities are generated on timesteps
that are a multiple of <I>Nfreq</I>.  The average is over <I>Nrepeat</I>
quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the simulation every
<I>Nevery</I> timesteps.  <I>Nfreq</I> must be a multiple of <I>Nevery</I> and
<I>Nevery</I> must be non-zero even if <I>Nrepeat</I> is 1.  Also, the timesteps
contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nfreq >
(Nrepeat-1)*Nevery is required.
</P>
<P>For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the compute calculates a per-surf vector, then the
per-surf vector is used.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column
per-surf array calculated by the compute.  If <I>c_ID</I> is used, and the
compute calculates a per-surf array, then it is the same as if the
individual columns of the array had been listed one by one.
</P>
<P>E.g. these 2 fix ave/surf commands are equivalent, since the <A HREF = "compute_surf">compute
surf</A> command produces 5 columns of output using the
<I>all</I> mixture-ID which has a single group:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 surf all n press px py pz
fix 1 ave/surf 10 100 1000 c_1
fix 1 ave/surf 10 100 1000 c_1[1] c_1[2] c_1[3] c_1[4] c_1[5] 
</PRE>
<P>Users can also write code for their own compute styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them
to SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the fix calculates a per-surf vector, then the per-surf
vector is used.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the range
from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column per-surf array
calculated by the fix.  If <I>f_ID</I> is used, and the fix calculates a
per-surf array, then it is the same as if the individual columns of
the array had been listed one by one.  See the example above for
computes.
</P>
<P>Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps,
which must be compatible with <I>Nevery</I>, else an error will result.
Users can also write code for their own fix styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them to
SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script as a <A HREF = "variable.html">surf-style
variable</A>.  Variables of style <I>surf</I> can reference
<A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A> keywords, or invoke other computes,
fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so this is a very general
means of generating per-surf quantities to time average.
</P>
<P>NOTE: The <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command does not yet support
surf-style varaibles.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For averaging of a value that comes from a compute or fix,
normalization is performed as follows.  If the compute or fix is
summing over particles to calculate a per-surf quantity (e.g. pressure
or energy flux), this takes the form of a numerator divided by a
denominator.  For example, see the formulas discussed on the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute
surf</A> doc page, where the denominator is 1 (for
keyword n), area times dt (timestep) for the other quantities (press,
shx, ke, etc).  When this command averages over a series of timesteps,
the numerator and denominator are summed separately.  This means the
numerator/denominator division only takes place when this fix produces
output, every Nfreq timesteps.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Give an example where the 2 ways of normalizing give different
answers, like with <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A>.  Not currently
the case for compute surf, since all denominators are (A*dt).
</P>
<P>For averaging of a value that comes from a surf-style variable, no
normalization is performed; the variable value is used as-is.  This
means you should define the variable so it performs any needed
normalization.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix. 
</P>
<P>The <I>ave</I> keyword determines what happens to the accumulation of
statistics every <I>Nfreq</I> timesteps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>one</I>, then the values produced on timesteps
that are multiples of Nfreq are independent of each other.
Normalization as described above is performed, and all tallies are
zeroed before accumulating over the next <I>Nfreq</I> steps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>running</I>, then tallies are never zeroed.
Thus the output at any <I>Nfreq</I> timestep is normalized over all
previously accumulated samples since the fix was defined.  The tallies
can only be zeroed by deleting the fix via the unfix command, or by
re-defining the fix, or by re-specifying it.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>This fix produces a per-surf vector or array which can be accessed by
various output commands.  A vector is produced if only a single
quantity is averaged by this fix.  If two or more quantities are
averaged, then an array of values is produced, where the number of
columns is the number of quantities averaged.  The per-surf values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of <I>Nfreq</I> since that
is when averaging is performed.
