reset_timestep command :h3

[Syntax:]

reset_timestep N :pre

N = timestep number :ul

[Examples:]

reset_timestep 0
reset_timestep 4000000 :pre

[Description:]

Set the timestep counter to the specified value.  This command
normally comes after the timestep has been set by reading a restart
file via the "read_restart"_read_restart.html command, or a previous
simulation advanced the timestep.

The "create_box"_create_box.html command sets the timestep to 0; the
"read_restart"_read_restart.html command sets the timestep to the
value it had when the restart file was written.

[Restrictions:] none

This command cannot be used when any fixes are defined that keep track
of elapsed time to perform certain kinds of time-dependent operations.
Examples are the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html, "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html, and "fix ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html
commands.  Thus these fixes should be specified after the timestep has
been reset.

Resetting the timestep clears flags for "computes"_compute.html that
may have calculated some quantity from a previous run.  This means
these quantity cannot be accessed by a variable in between runs until
a new run is performed.  See the "variable"_variable.html command for
more details.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
