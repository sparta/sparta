species_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

species_modify ID property value ... :pre

ID, property, value can be repeated one or more times :ulb,l
ID = species ID :l
property = {mu} :l
  mu = magnetic moment :pre
value = value of property for that species :l
  value for {mu} (magnetic moment units) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

species_modify Fe mu 2.0 Cr mu 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set additional properties of one or more species used in a simulation.
This can be used as many times as desired for different species and
properties.  Currently it only supports setting of a single optional
property (the magnetic moment) which is not included in the species
files read in by the "species"_species.html command.

Each {ID} is a character string used to identify a species, such as N
or O2 or NO or D or Fe-.  See the "species"_species.html command for
how species are added to a simulation model by reading their
properties from a species file.

The only property currently recognized is {mu} or the scalar magnetic
moment of each particle of the species.  The {value} for the {mu}
property should be specified in the units described on the
"units"_units.html doc page.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

No magnetic moments are defined for any species (all 0.0).
