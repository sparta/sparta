[Description:]

Define a calculation that "reduces" one or more vector inputs into
scalar values, one per listed input.  The inputs can be per-particle
or per-grid or per-surf quantities; they cannot be global quantities.
Particle attributes are per-particle quantities,
"computes"_compute.html may generate per-particle or per-grid
quantities, "fixes"_fix.html may generate any of the three kinds of
quantities, and "particle-style or grid-style variables"_variable.html
generate per-particle or per-grid quantities.  See the
"variable"_variable command and its special functions which can
perform the same operations as the compute reduce command on global
vectors.

The reduction operation is specified by the {mode} setting.  The {sum}
option adds the values in the vector into a global total.  The {min}
or {max} options find the minimum or maximum value across all vector
values.  The {ave} setting adds the vector values into a global total,
then divides by the number of values in the vector.  The {sumsq}
option sums the square of the values in the vector into a global
total.  The {avesq} setting does the same as {sumsq}, then divdes the
sum of squares by the number of values.  The last two options can be
useful for calculating the variance of some quantity, e.g. variance =
sumsq - ave^2.

Each listed input is operated on independently.

Each listed input can be a particle attribute or can be the result of
a "compute"_compute.html or "fix"_fix.html or the evaluation of a
"variable"_variable.html.

Note that for values from a compute or fix, the bracketed index I can
be specified using a wildcard asterisk with the index to effectively
specify multiple values.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or
"m*n".  If N = the size of the vector (for {mode} = scalar) or the
number of columns in the array (for {mode} = vector), then an asterisk
with no numeric values means all indices from 1 to N.  A leading
asterisk means all indices from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing
asterisk means all indices from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk
means all indices from m to n (inclusive).

Using a wildcard is the same as if the individual columns of the array
had been listed one by one.  E.g. these 2 compute reduce commands are
equivalent, since the "compute grid"_compute_grid.html command creates
a per-grid array with 3 columns:

compute myGrid all u v w
compute 2 all reduce min c_myGrid\[*\]
compute 2 all reduce min c_myGrid\[1\] c_myGrid\[2\] c_myGrid\[3\] :pre

:line

The particle attributes x,y,z,vx,vy,vz are position and velocity
components.  The ke,erot,evib attributes are for kinetic, rotational,
and vibrational energy of particles.

If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  Computes can generate
per-particle or per-grid quantities.  See the individual
"compute"_compute.html doc page for details.  If no bracketed integer
is appended, the vector calculated by the compute is used.  If a
bracketed integer is appended, the Ith column of the array calculated
by the compute is used.  Users can also write code for their own
compute styles and "add them to SPARTA"_Section_modify.html.  See the
discussion above for how I can be specified with a wildcard asterisk
to effectively specify multiple values.

IMPORTANT NOTE: A compute which generates per-surf quantities cannot
be used as input.  This is because its values have not yet been
combined across processors to sum the contributions from all
processors whose particles collide with the same surface element.  The
combining is performed by the "fix ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html
command, at each of its {Nfreq} timesteps.  Thus to use this compute
on per-surf values, specify a fix ID for a "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html and insure the fix outputs its values when
they are needed.

If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  Fixes can generate
per-particle or per-grid or per-surf quantities.  See the individual
"fix"_fix.html doc page for details.  Note that some fixes only
produce their values on certain timesteps, which must be compatible
with when this compute references the values, else an error results.
If no bracketed integer is appended, the vector calculated by the fix
is used.  If a bracketed integer is appended, the Ith column of the
array calculated by the fix is used.  Users can also write code for
their own fix style and "add them to SPARTA"_Section_modify.html.  See
the discussion above for how I can be specified with a wildcard
asterisk to effectively specify multiple values.

If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script.  It must be a
"particle-style or grid-style variable"_variable.html.  Both styles
define formulas which can reference stats keywords or invoke other
computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated.  Particle-style
variables can also reference various per-particle attributes
(position, velocity, etc).  So these variables are a very general
means of creating per-particle or per-grid quantities to reduce.

If the {replace} keyword is used, two indices {vec1} and {vec2} are
specified, where each index ranges from 1 to the # of input values.
The replace keyword can only be used if the {mode} is {min} or {max}.
It works as follows.  A min/max is computed as usual on the {vec2}
input vector.  The index N of that value within {vec2} is also stored.
Then, instead of performing a min/max on the {vec1} input vector, the
stored index is used to select the Nth element of the {vec1} vector.

Here is an example which prints out both the grid cell ID and number
of particles for the grid cell with the maximum number of particles:

compute 1 property/grid id
compute	2 grid all n
compute	3 reduce max c_1 c_2\[1\] replace 1 2
stats_style step c_temp c_3\[1\] c_3\[2\] :pre

The first two input values in the compute reduce command are vectors
with the ID and particle count of each grid cell.  Instead of taking
the max of the ID vector, which does not yield useful information in
this context, the {replace} keyword will extract the ID for the grid
cell which has the maximum number of particles.  This ID and the
cell's particle count will be printed with the statistical output.

If a single input is specified this compute produces a global scalar
value.  If multiple inputs are specified, this compute produces a
global vector of values, the length of which is equal to the number of
inputs specified.

:line

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar if a single input value is
specified or a global vector of length N where N is the number of
inputs, and which can be accessed by indices 1 to N.  These values can
be used by any command that uses global scalar or vector values from a
compute as input.  See "Section 4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an
overview of SPARTA output options.

The scalar or vector values will be in whatever "units"_units.html the
quantities being reduced are in.
