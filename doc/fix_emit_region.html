</P>
<P>Emit particles from within a group of grid cells, continuously during
a simulation.  In invoked every timestep, this fix creates a
continuous influx of particles within a geometric region of the
simulation box.  It is designed to be used when coupling SPARTA to a
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code using a simulation geometry
similar to the following diagram:
</P>
<P>NOTE: insert a 3-subdomain figure for CFD, CFD+DSMC, DSMC regions.
</P>
<P>This fix performs two operations each time it is invoked.  The first
operation is to delete all particles within grid cells in the
specified group.  The second operation is to insert new particles in
the same grid cells.  This fix thus effectively replaces all particles
with the group of grid cells.  Note that particles are only deleted
and added to cells which are not intersected by surface elements.
</P>
<P>Properties of the added particles are determined by the mixture with
ID <I>mix-ID</I>.  The mixture density determines the number of particles
added to each grid cell, consistent with its size and the <I>fnum</I> ratio
specified by the <A HREF = "global.html"">global</A> command.
</P>
<P>If the number of particles <I>M</I> to add to a cell has a fractional
value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are added, and a 13th depending on
the value of a random number.  Each particle is added at a random
location within the grid cell.  The particle species is chosen
randomly in accord with the <I>frac</I> settings of the collection of
species in the mixture, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each new particle is assigned a thermal velocity consistent with the
thermal temperature of the mixture and the specified <I>mode</I> setting.
For <I>mb</I> the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is used, the same as for
the <A HREF = "create_particles.html">create_particles</A> command.  For <I>ce</I> the
Chapman-Enskog distribution is used.
</P>
<P>NOTE: add a description of the C-E distribution, words and equations.
Explain why the user would want to use one versus the other.
</P>
<P>The total velocity of each particle is set to the sum of its thermal
velocity and the streaming velocity of the mixture.  The internal
energy modes of the particle are determined by the <I>trot</I> and <I>tvib</I>
settings of the mixture and the <I>rotate</I> and <I>vibrate</I> options of the
<A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command.  Note that if the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.
</P>
<P>NOTE: explain more about how CFD + DSMC coupling is performed using
this fix.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> keyword can alter how many particles are added, which can be
useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>Np</I> is set to 0, then the number
of added particles is a function of <I>fnum</I>, <I>nrho</I>, and other mixture
settings, as described above.  If <I>Np</I> is set to a value > 0, then the
<I>fnum</I> and <I>nrho</I> settings are ignored, and exactly <I>Np</I> particles are
added on each insertion timestep.  This is done by dividing <I>Np</I> by
the total number of grid cells that are adjacent to the specified box
faces and adding an equal number of particles per grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are added.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.

<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles added on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number added since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
