compute distsurf/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID distsurf surfID keyword args ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
distsurf/grid = style name of this compute command :l
surfID = group ID for which surface elements to consider :l
zero or more keyword/args pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {dir} :l
  {dir} args = Sx Sy Sz
    Sx,Sy,Sz = vector components used to test surf elements :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 distsurf/grid all
compute 1 distsurf/grid sphere2 dir 1 0 0 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the minimum distance from each
grid cell to any surface element.  This is useful for grid adaptation;
the "adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html command can use the compute as a
criterion for refining or coarsening individual grid cells.

The set of surface elements considered is determined in the following
manner.  Only surface elements in the specified {surfID} group are
included.  Surface groups can be deinfed by the "group
surf"_group.html command.

If the {dir} keyword is specified it can exclude additional surface
elements.  The Sx,Sy,Sz settings are components of a vector.  It's
length does not matter, just its direction.  Only surface elements
whose normal is opposed to the vector direction (in a dot product
sense) are eligible surfaces for the distance calculations.  This can
be useful to exclude surface elements that are not facing "upwind"
with respect to the flow direction of the particles.  This is
accomplished by setting Sx,Sy,Sz to the flow direction.  If Sy,Sy,Sz =
(0,0,0), which is the default, then no surface elements are excluded.

Each grid cell also only considers a subset of eligible surfaces in
its distance calculations.  A vector from the grid cell center to the
center of each surface element is calculated.  If that vector is
opposed to the surface normal vector (in a dot product sense), the
distance from the grid cell to the surface is calculated.  This means
that for an individual grid cell, only surface elements that are
"facing" the grid cell are considered.

The "distance" between a grid cell and a surface element is the
minimum distance between the two geometric entities.  If the surface
elemene overlaps with the grid cell, the distance is 0.0.  Otherwise
the distance is the minimum distance between the perimeter of the grid
cell and the line segment (in 2d) or the perimeter of the triangle (in
3d).

Here is an example of using this compute with the
"adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html command to adapt the grid around the
upwind side of a circular object (flow is from the left boundary of
the box).  The first adapt_grid command uses a threshold distance
value of 0.5 to create refine grid cells once.  The second adapt_grid
command uses a threshold distance value of 0.1 to create some of the
grid cells closer to the surface a second time.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid vector whose values are the
distances of each grid cell from any of the surface elements.

This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See "Section 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.

The vector can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-grid array values for the vector will be in distance
"units"_units.html.
