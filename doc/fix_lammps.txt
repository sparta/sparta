fix lammps command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID lammps group-ID Nevery source :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
lammps = style name of this fix command :l
group-ID = group ID for which grid cells to consider  :l
Nevery = couple to LAMMPS once every Nevery steps :l
source = computeID :l
  computeID = c_ID for a compute that calculates per grid number density values :pre,ule

[Examples:]

group face grid region front all
compute 1 grid all all nrho
fix md lammps face_grid 100 c_1 :pre

[Description:]

Concurrently couple a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to SPARTA. 
This command will invoke an instance of the MD software package 
"LAMMPS"_https://lammps.org every Nevery steps. It automatically 
translates DSMC properties to a classical molecular dynamics domain, 
requiring the per-grid number density as an additional input. A 
user-defined group of cells can be selected for coupling.

This fix creates an MD simulation based on the current state of the
SPARTA simulation as described in "(Linke25)"_#Linke25. It accesses 
the position and velocity of particles and decomposes them into atoms 
with no restriction to fnum. Based on the provided group-ID, one or 
more cells are coupled to MD and atomistic information is calculated. 
The insights are automatically passed back to SPARTA and the simulation 
continues.

Note that this fix requires knowledge of molecular dynamics. To adjust
the MD simulation, you must edit the LAMMPS input script constructed 
in the Lifting operator in src/fix_lammps.cpp. To adjust the 
information passed from the MD to the DSMC domain, you must edit the 
Restricting operator in src/fix_lammps.cpp. 

In its provided form, fix lammps calculates the temperature of a nickel 
surface in an air flow. The temperature is passed back to SPARTA for a 
more accurate surface-flow interaction. See the examples/couple 
directory for input scripts that use this fix.

Note that this fix can be run in parallel. For parallel runs, the MD instance
will inherit all procs for the MD simulation. GPUs can also be employed through the 
KOKKOS package and extending input arguments to the LAMMPS instance (see src/fix_lammps.cpp).

The specified {group-ID} must be the name of a grid cell group,
as defined by the "group grid"_group.html command, which contains a
set of grid cells.

The specfied {Nevery} determines how often the DSMC-MD coupling
takes place.

The {source} is a per-grid quantity calculated by a
compute, such as the "compute grid"_compute_grid.html command. It must
calculate the number density of all cells.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

However, in its provided formulation, this fix defines a custom surface 
attribute that is written to the restart file.  Namely the 
floating-point vector of temperature values for each surface with the 
name {temperature}.  As explained on the "read_restart"_read_restart.html 
doc page these values will be re-assigned to surface when a restart file
is read.  If a new fix lammps command is specified in the restart
script as well as a surface collision model which uses the custom
attribute updated by this fix, then the per-surf temperatures and
updating process will continue to be used in the continued run.

No global or per-surf quantities are stored by this fix for access by
various output commands.

However, the per-surf attribute defined by this fix can be
accessed by the "dump surf"_dump.html command, as s_temperature.  That means
those per-surf values can be written to surface dump files. See the 
examples/couple directory for an input script where this is shown.

[Restrictions:]

In its provided formulation, this fix can only be used to calculate the
temperature of a nickel surface in an air flow. However, this fix provides
the framework that allows for easy adaptation to the specific needs of a 
coupled DSMC-MD simulation. Templates for various adjustments can be found in
src/fix_lammps.cpp.
