11. Python interface to SPARTA :h3

This section describes how to build and use SPARTA via a Python
interface.

11.1 "Building SPARTA as a shared library"_#py_1
11.2 "Installing the Python wrapper into Python"_#py_2
11.3 "Extending Python with MPI to run in parallel"_#py_3
11.4 "Testing the Python-SPARTA interface"_#py_4
11.5 "Using SPARTA from Python"_#py_5
11.6 "Example Python scripts that use SPARTA"_#py_6 :ul

The SPARTA distribution includes the file python/sparta.py which wraps
the library interface to SPARTA.  This file makes it possible to
run SPARTA, invoke SPARTA commands or give it an input script, extract
SPARTA results, and modify internal SPARTA variables, either from a
Python script or interactively from a Python prompt.  You can do the
former in serial or parallel.  Running Python interactively in
parallel does not generally work, unless you have a package installed
that extends your Python to enable multiple instances of Python to
read what you type.

"Python"_http://www.python.org is a powerful scripting and programming
language which can be used to wrap software like SPARTA and many other
packages.  It can be used to glue multiple pieces of software
together, e.g. to run a coupled or multiscale model.  See "Section
4.7"_Section_howto.html#howto_7 of the manual and the examples/COUPLE
directory of the distribution for more ideas about coupling SPARTA to
other codes.  See "Section 2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4 about how
to build SPARTA as a library, and "Section
4.6"_Section_howto.html#howto_6 for a description of the library
interface provided in src/library.cpp and src/library.h and how to
extend it for your needs.  As described below, that interface is what
is exposed to Python.  It is designed to be easy to add functions to.
This can extend the Python inteface as well.  See details below.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The examples/COUPLE dir has not been added to the
distribution yet.

By using the Python interface, SPARTA can also be coupled with a GUI
or other visualization tools that display graphs or animations in real
time as SPARTA runs.  Examples of such scripts are included in the
python directory.

Two advantages of using Python are how concise the language is, and
that it can be run interactively, enabling rapid development and
debugging of programs.  If you use it to mostly invoke costly
operations within SPARTA, such as running a simulation for a
reasonable number of timesteps, then the overhead cost of invoking
SPARTA thru Python will be negligible.

Before using SPARTA from a Python script, you need to do two things.
You need to build SPARTA as a dynamic shared library, so it can be
loaded by Python.  And you need to tell Python how to find the library
and the Python wrapper file python/sparta.py.  Both these steps are
discussed below.  If you wish to run SPARTA in parallel from Python,
you also need to extend your Python with MPI.  This is also discussed
below.

The Python wrapper for SPARTA uses the amazing and magical (to me)
"ctypes" package in Python, which auto-generates the interface code
needed between Python and a set of C interface routines for a library.
Ctypes is part of standard Python for versions 2.5 and later.  You can
check which version of Python you have installed, by simply typing
"python" at a shell prompt.

11.1 Building SPARTA as a shared library :link(py_1),h4

Instructions on how to build SPARTA as a shared library are given in
"Section 2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4.  A shared library is one
that is dynamically loadable, which is what Python requires.  On Linux
this is a library file that ends in ".so", not ".a".

For make, from the src directory, type

make mode=shlib foo :pre

For CMake, from the build directory, tyoe

cmake -C /path/to/sparta/cmake/presets/foo.cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON /path/to/sparta/cmake
make :pre

where foo is the machine target name, such as icc or g++ or serial.
This should create the file libsparta_foo.so in the src directory, as
well as a soft link libsparta.so, which is what the Python wrapper
will load by default.  Note that if you are building multiple machine
versions of the shared library, the soft link is always set to the
most recently built version.

If this fails, see "Section 2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 for more
details, especially if your SPARTA build uses auxiliary libraries like
MPI which may not be built as shared libraries on your system.

:line

11.2 Installing the Python wrapper into Python :link(py_2),h4

For Python to invoke SPARTA, there are 2 files it needs to know about:

python/sparta.py
src/libsparta.so :ul

Sparta.py is the Python wrapper on the SPARTA library interface.
Libsparta.so is the shared SPARTA library that Python loads, as
described above.

You can insure Python can find these files in one of two ways:

set two environment variables
run the python/install.py script :ul

If you set the paths to these files as environment variables, you only
have to do it once.  For the csh or tcsh shells, add something like
this to your ~/.cshrc file, one line for each of the two files:

setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/home/sjplimp/sparta/python
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/sjplimp/sparta/src :pre

If you use the python/install.py script, you need to invoke it every
time you rebuild SPARTA (as a shared library) or make changes to the
python/sparta.py file.

You can invoke install.py from the python directory as

% python install.py \[libdir\] \[pydir\] :pre

The optional libdir is where to copy the SPARTA shared library to; the
default is /usr/local/lib.  The optional pydir is where to copy the
sparta.py file to; the default is the site-packages directory of the
version of Python that is running the install script.

Note that libdir must be a location that is in your default
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, like /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.  And pydir must be a
location that Python looks in by default for imported modules, like
its site-packages dir.  If you want to copy these files to
non-standard locations, such as within your own user space, you will
need to set your PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
accordingly, as above.

If the install.py script does not allow you to copy files into system
directories, prefix the python command with "sudo".  If you do this,
make sure that the Python that root runs is the same as the Python you
run.  E.g. you may need to do something like

% sudo /usr/local/bin/python install.py \[libdir\] \[pydir\] :pre

You can also invoke install.py from the make command in the src
directory as

% make install-python :pre

In this mode you cannot append optional arguments.  Again, you may
need to prefix this with "sudo".  In this mode you cannot control
which Python is invoked by root.

Note that if you want Python to be able to load different versions of
the SPARTA shared library (see "this section"_#py_5 below), you will
need to manually copy files like libsparta_g++.so into the appropriate
system directory.  This is not needed if you set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable as described above.

11.3 Extending Python with MPI to run in parallel :link(py_3),h4

If you wish to run SPARTA in parallel from Python, you need to extend
your Python with an interface to MPI.  This also allows you to
make MPI calls directly from Python in your script, if you desire.

There are several Python packages available that purport to wrap MPI
as a library and allow MPI functions to be called from Python.

These include

"pyMPI"_http://pympi.sourceforge.net/
"maroonmpi"_http://code.google.com/p/maroonmpi/
"mpi4py"_http://code.google.com/p/mpi4py/
"myMPI"_http://nbcr.sdsc.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?t=89&sid=c997fefc3933bd66204875b436940f16
"Pypar"_http://code.google.com/p/pypar :ul

All of these except pyMPI work by wrapping the MPI library and
exposing (some portion of) its interface to your Python script.  This
means Python cannot be used interactively in parallel, since they do
not address the issue of interactive input to multiple instances of
Python running on different processors.  The one exception is pyMPI,
which alters the Python interpreter to address this issue, and (I
believe) creates a new alternate executable (in place of "python"
itself) as a result.

In principle any of these Python/MPI packages should work to invoke
SPARTA in parallel and MPI calls themselves from a Python script which
is itself running in parallel.  However, when I downloaded and looked
at a few of them, their documentation was incomplete and I had trouble
with their installation.  It's not clear if some of the packages are
still being actively developed and supported.

The one I recommend, since I have successfully used it with SPARTA, is
Pypar.  Pypar requires the ubiquitous "Numpy
package"_http://numpy.scipy.org be installed in your Python.  After
launching python, type

import numpy :pre

to see if it is installed.  If not, here is how to install it (version
1.3.0b1 as of April 2009).  Unpack the numpy tarball and from its
top-level directory, type

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install :pre

The "sudo" is only needed if required to copy Numpy files into your
Python distribution's site-packages directory.

To install Pypar (version pypar-2.1.4_94 as of Aug 2012), unpack it
and from its "source" directory, type

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install :pre

Again, the "sudo" is only needed if required to copy Pypar files into
your Python distribution's site-packages directory.

If you have successully installed Pypar, you should be able to run
Python and type

import pypar :pre

without error.  You should also be able to run python in parallel
on a simple test script

% mpirun -np 4 python test.py :pre

where test.py contains the lines

import pypar
print "Proc %d out of %d procs" % (pypar.rank(),pypar.size()) :pre

and see one line of output for each processor you run on.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To use Pypar and SPARTA in parallel from Python, you
must insure both are using the same version of MPI.  If you only have
one MPI installed on your system, this is not an issue, but it can be
if you have multiple MPIs.  Your SPARTA build is explicit about which
MPI it is using, since you specify the details in your lo-level
src/MAKE/Makefile.foo file.  Pypar uses the "mpicc" command to find
information about the MPI it uses to build against.  And it tries to
load "libmpi.so" from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This may or may not find
the MPI library that SPARTA is using.  If you have problems running
both Pypar and SPARTA together, this is an issue you may need to
address, e.g. by moving other MPI installations so that Pypar finds
the right one.

:line

11.4 Testing the Python-SPARTA interface :link(py_4),h4

To test if SPARTA is callable from Python, launch Python interactively
and type:

>>> from sparta import sparta
>>> spa = sparta() :pre

If you get no errors, you're ready to use SPARTA from Python.  If the
2nd command fails, the most common error to see is

OSError: Could not load SPARTA dynamic library :pre

which means Python was unable to load the SPARTA shared library.  This
typically occurs if the system can't find the SPARTA shared library or
one of the auxiliary shared libraries it depends on, or if something
about the library is incompatible with your Python.  The error message
should give you an indication of what went wrong.

You can also test the load directly in Python as follows, without
first importing from the sparta.py file:

>>> from ctypes import CDLL
>>> CDLL("libsparta.so") :pre

If an error occurs, carefully go thru the steps in "Section
2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4 and above about building a shared
library and about insuring Python can find the necessary two files it
needs.

[Test SPARTA and Python in serial:] :h5

To run a SPARTA test in serial, type these lines into Python
interactively from the bench directory:

>>> from sparta import sparta
>>> spa = sparta()
>>> spa.file("in.free") :pre

Or put the same lines in the file test.py and run it as

% python test.py :pre

Either way, you should see the results of running the in.free
benchmark on a single processor appear on the screen, the same as if
you had typed something like:

spa_g++ < in.free :pre

You can also pass command-line switches, e.g. to set input script
variables, through the Python interface.

Replacing the "spa = sparta()" line above with

spa = sparta("",["-v","x","100","-v","y","100","-v","z","100"]) :pre

is the same as typing 

spa_g++ -v x 100 -v y 100 -v z 100 < in.free :pre

from the command line.

[Test SPARTA and Python in parallel:] :h5

To run SPARTA in parallel, assuming you have installed the
"Pypar"_http://datamining.anu.edu.au/~ole/pypar package as discussed
above, create a test.py file containing these lines:

import pypar
from sparta import sparta
spa = sparta()
spa.file("in.free")
print "Proc %d out of %d procs has" % (pypar.rank(),pypar.size()),lmp
pypar.finalize() :pre

You can then run it in parallel as:

% mpirun -np 4 python test.py :pre

and you should see the same output as if you had typed

% mpirun -np 4 spa_g++ < in.lj :pre

Note that if you leave out the 3 lines from test.py that specify Pypar
commands you will instantiate and run SPARTA independently on each of
the P processors specified in the mpirun command.  In this case you
should get 4 sets of output, each showing that a SPARTA run was made
on a single processor, instead of one set of output showing that
SPARTA ran on 4 processors.  If the 1-processor outputs occur, it
means that Pypar is not working correctly.

Also note that once you import the PyPar module, Pypar initializes MPI
for you, and you can use MPI calls directly in your Python script, as
described in the Pypar documentation.  The last line of your Python
script should be pypar.finalize(), to insure MPI is shut down
correctly.

[Running Python scripts:] :h5

Note that any Python script (not just for SPARTA) can be invoked in
one of several ways:

% python foo.script
% python -i foo.script
% foo.script :pre

The last command requires that the first line of the script be
something like this:

#!/usr/local/bin/python 
#!/usr/local/bin/python -i :pre

where the path points to where you have Python installed, and requires
that you have made the script file executable:

% chmod +x foo.script :pre

Without the "-i" flag, Python will exit when the script finishes.
With the "-i" flag, you will be left in the Python interpreter when
the script finishes, so you can type subsequent commands.  As
mentioned above, you can only run Python interactively when running
Python on a single processor, not in parallel.

11.5 Using SPARTA from Python :link(py_5),h4

The Python interface to SPARTA consists of a Python "sparta" module,
the source code for which is in python/sparta.py, which creates a
"sparta" object, with a set of methods that can be invoked on that
object.  The sample Python code below assumes you have first imported
the "sparta" module in your Python script, as follows:

from sparta import sparta :pre

These are the methods defined by the sparta module.  If you look
at the file src/library.cpp you will see that they correspond
one-to-one with calls you can make to the SPARTA library from a C++ or
C or Fortran program.

spa = sparta()           # create a SPARTA object using the default libsparta.so library
spa = sparta("g++")      # create a SPARTA object using the libsparta_g++.so library
spa = sparta("",list)    # ditto, with command-line args, e.g. list = \["-echo","screen"\]
spa = sparta("g++",list) :pre

spa.close()              # destroy a SPARTA object :pre

spa.file(file)           # run an entire input script, file = "in.lj"
spa.command(cmd)         # invoke a single SPARTA command, cmd = "run 100" :pre

fnum = spa.extract_global(name,type) # extract a global quantity
                                     # name = "dt", "fnum", etc
				     # type = 0 = int
				     #        1 = double :pre

temp = spa.extract_compute(id,style,type) # extract value(s) from a compute
                                          # id = ID of compute
					  # style = 0 = global data
					  #	    1 = per particle data
					  #	    2 = per grid cell data
					  #	    3 = per surf element data
					  # type = 0 = scalar
					  #	   1 = vector
					  #        2 = array :pre

var = spa.extract_variable(name,flag)  # extract value(s) from a variable
	                               # name = name of variable
				       # flag = 0 = equal-style variable
				       #        1 = particle-style variable :pre

:line

IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently, the creation of a SPARTA object from within
sparta.py does not take an MPI communicator as an argument.  There
should be a way to do this, so that the SPARTA instance runs on a
subset of processors if desired, but I don't know how to do it from
Pypar.  So for now, it runs with MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is all the
processors.  If someone figures out how to do this with one or more of
the Python wrappers for MPI, like Pypar, please let us know and we
will amend these doc pages.

Note that you can create multiple SPARTA objects in your Python
script, and coordinate and run multiple simulations, e.g.

from sparta import sparta
spa1 = sparta()
spa2 = sparta()
spa1.file("in.file1")
spa2.file("in.file2") :pre

The file() and command() methods allow an input script or single
commands to be invoked.

The extract_global(), extract_compute(), and extract_variable()
methods return values or pointers to data structures internal to
SPARTA.

For extract_global() see the src/library.cpp file for the list of
valid names.  New names can easily be added.  A double or integer is
returned.  You need to specify the appropriate data type via the type
argument.

For extract_compute(), the global, per particle, per grid cell, or per
surface element results calulated by the compute can be accessed.
What is returned depends on whether the compute calculates a scalar or
vector or array.  For a scalar, a single double value is returned.  If
the compute or fix calculates a vector or array, a pointer to the
internal SPARTA data is returned, which you can use via normal Python
subscripting.  See "Section 6.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 of the
manual for a discussion of global, per particle, per grid, and per
surf data, and of scalar, vector, and array data types.  See the doc
pages for individual "computes"_compute.html for a description of what
they calculate and store.

For extract_variable(), an "equal-style or particle-style
variable"_variable.html is evaluated and its result returned.

For equal-style variables a single double value is returned and the
group argument is ignored.  For particle-style variables, a vector of
doubles is returned, one value per particle, which you can use via
normal Python subscripting.

:line 

As noted above, these Python class methods correspond one-to-one with
the functions in the SPARTA library interface in src/library.cpp and
library.h.  This means you can extend the Python wrapper via the
following steps:

Add a new interface function to src/library.cpp and
src/library.h. :ulb,l

Rebuild SPARTA as a shared library. :l

Add a wrapper method to python/sparta.py for this interface
function. :l

You should now be able to invoke the new interface function from a
Python script.  Isn't ctypes amazing? :l,ule

11.6 Example Python scripts that use SPARTA :link(py_6),h4

There are demonstration Python scripts included in the python/examples
directory of the SPARTA distribution, to illustrate what is possible
when Python wraps SPARTA.

See the python/README file for more details.
