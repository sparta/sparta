</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Modify the parameters of a previously defined dump command.  Not all
parameters are relevant to all dump styles.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<P>These keywords apply to various dump styles, including the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> style.  The description gives details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>append</I> keyword applies to all dump styles except <I>image</I>.  It
also applies only to text output files, not to binary or gzipped
files.  If specified as <I>yes</I>, then dump snapshots are appended to the
end of an existing dump file.  If specified as <I>no</I>, then a new dump
file will be created which will overwrite an existing file with the
same name.  This keyword can only take effect if the dump_modify
command is used after the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command, but before the
first command that causes dump snapshots to be output, e.g. a
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.  Once the dump file has been opened, this
keyword has no further effect.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>every</I> keyword changes the dump frequency originally specified by
the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command to a new value.  The every keyword can be
specified in one of two ways.  It can be a numeric value in which case
it must be > 0.  Or it can be an <A HREF = "variable.html">equal-style variable</A>,
which should be specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.
In this case, the variable is evaluated at the beginning of a run to
determine the next timestep at which a dump snapshot will be written
out.  On that timestep, the variable will be evaluated again to
determine the next timestep, etc.  Thus the variable should return
timestep values.  See the stagger() and logfreq() math functions for
<A HREF = "variable.html">equal-style variables</A>, as examples of useful functions
to use in this context.  Other similar math functions could easily be
added as options for <A HREF = "variable.html">equal-style variables</A>.  When
using the variable option with the <I>every</I> keyword, you also need to
use the <I>first</I> option if you want an initial snapshot written to the
dump file.
</P>
<P>For example, the following commands will
write snapshots at timesteps 0,10,20,30,100,200,300,1000,2000,etc:
</P>
<PRE>variable	        s equal logfreq(10,3,10)
dump		1 all particle 100 tmp.dump id type x y z
dump_modify	1 every v_s first yes 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>The <I>first</I> keyword determines whether a dump snapshot is written on
the very first timestep after the dump command is invoked.  This will
always occur if the current timestep is a multiple of N, the frequency
specified in the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command, including timestep 0.  But
if this is not the case, a dump snapshot will only be written if the
setting of this keyword is <I>yes</I>.  If it is <I>no</I>, which is the
default, then it will not be written.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>flush</I> keyword applies to dump styles that write multiple
successive snapshots to the same file.  It determines whether a flush
operation is invoked after a dump snapshot is written to the dump
file.  A flush insures the output in that file is current (no
buffering by the OS), even if SPARTA halts before the simulation
completes.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The text-based dump styles have a default C-style format string which
simply specifies %d for integers and %g for real values.  The <I>format</I>
keyword can be used to override the default with a new C-style format
string.  Do not include a trailing "\n" newline character in the
format string.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>pad</I> keyword only applies when the dump filename is specified
with a wildcard "*" character which becomes the timestep.  If <I>pad</I> is
0, which is the default, the timestep is converted into a string of
unpadded length, e.g. 100 or 12000 or 2000000.  When <I>pad</I> is
specified with <I>Nchar</I> > 0, the string is padded with leading zeroes
so they are all the same length = <I>Nchar</I>.  For example, pad 7 would
yield 0000100, 0012000, 2000000.  This can be useful so that
post-processing programs can easily read the files in ascending
timestep order.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>region</I> keyword only applies to the dump <I>particle</I> and <I>image</I>
styles.  If specified, only particles in the region will be written to
the dump file or included in the image.  Only one region can be
applied as a filter (the last one specified).  See the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command for more details.  Note that a region can
be defined as the "inside" or "outside" of a geometric shape, and it
can be the "union" or "intersection" of a series of simpler regions.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>thresh</I> keyword only applies to the dump <I>particle</I> and <I>image</I>
styles.  Multiple thresholds can be specified.  Specifying "none"
turns off all threshold criteria.  If thresholds are specified, only
particles whose attributes meet all the threshold criteria are written
to the dump file or included in the image.  The possible attributes
that can be tested for are the same as those that can be specified in
the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump particle</A> command.  Note that different attributes
can be output by the dump particle command than are used as threshold
criteria by the dump_modify command.  E.g. you can output the
coordinates of particles whose velocity components are above some
threshold.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<P>These keywords apply only to the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> style.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>backcolor</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command to set the background color of the
images.  The color name can be any of the 140 pre-defined colors (see
below) or a color name defined by the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>boxcolor</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command to set the color of the simulation box
drawn around the particles in each image.  See the "dump image box"
command for how to specify that a box be drawn.  The color name can be
any of the 140 pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined
by the dump_modify color option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>cmap</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command to define a color map that is used to draw "objects" which can
be particles, grid cells, or surface elements.  The mode setting must
be <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I> or <I>gridx</I> or <I>gridy</I> or <I>gridz</I> which
correspond to the same keywords in the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Color maps are used to assign a specific RGB (red/green/blue) color
value to an individual object when it is drawn, based on the object's
attribute, which is a numeric value, e.g. the x-component of velocity
for a particle, if the particle-attribute "vx" was specified in the
<A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> command.
</P>
<P>The basic idea of a color map is that the attribute will be within a
range of values, and that range is associated with a a series of
colors (e.g. red, blue, green).  A specific value (vx = -3.2) can then
mapped to the series of colors (e.g. halfway between red and blue),
and a specific color is determined via an interpolation procedure.
</P>
<P>There are many possible options for the color map, enabled by the
<I>cmap</I> keyword.  Here are the details.
</P>
<P>The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings determine the range of values allowed for
the attribute.  If numeric values are used for <I>lo</I> and/or <I>hi</I>, then
values that are lower/higher than that value are set to the value.
I.e. the range is static.  If <I>lo</I> is specified as <I>min</I> or <I>hi</I> as
<I>max</I> then the range is dynamic, and the lower and/or upper bound will
be calculated each time an image is drawn, based on the set of objects
being visualized.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting is two letters, such as "ca".  The first letter is
either "c" for continuous, "d" for discrete, or "s" for sequential.
The second letter is either "a" for absolute, or "f" for fractional.
</P>
<P>A continuous color map is one in which the color changes continuously
from value to value within the range.  A discrete color map is one in
which discrete colors are assigned to sub-ranges of values within the
range.  A sequential color map is one in which discrete colors are
assigned to a sequence of sub-ranges of values covering the entire
range.
</P>
<P>An absolute color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified explicitly as values within the range.  A
fractional color map is one in which the values to which colors are
assigned are specified as a fractional portion of the range.  For
example if the range is from -10.0 to 10.0, and the color red is to be
assigned to objects with a value of 5.0, then for an absolute color
map the number 5.0 would be used.  But for a fractional map, the
number 0.75 would be used since 5.0 is 3/4 of the way from -10.0 to
10.0.
</P>
<P>The <I>delta</I> setting is only specified if the style is sequential.  It
specifies the bin size to use within the range for assigning
consecutive colors to.  For example, if the range is from -10.0 to
10.0 and a <I>delta</I> of 1.0 is used, then 20 colors will be assigned to
the range.  The first will be from -10.0 <= color1 < -9.0, then 2nd
from -9.0 <= color2 < -8.0, etc.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> setting is how many entries follow.  The format of the entries
depends on whether the color map style is continuous, discrete or
sequential.  In all cases the <I>color</I> setting can be any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.
</P>
<P>For continuous color maps, each entry has a <I>value</I> and a <I>color</I>.
The <I>value</I> is either a number within the range of values or <I>min</I> or
<I>max</I>.  The <I>value</I> of the first entry must be <I>min</I> and the <I>value</I>
of the last entry must be <I>max</I>.  Any entries in between must have
increasing values.  Note that numeric values can be specified either
as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to 1.0) of the range,
depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual object, given the value X of its attribute.  X will fall
between 2 of the entry values.  The color of the object is linearly
interpolated (in each of the RGB values) between the 2 colors
associated with those entries.  For example, if X = -5.0 and the 2
surrounding entries are "red" at -10.0 and "blue" at 0.0, then the
object's color will be halfway between "red" and "blue", which happens
to be "purple".
</P>
<P>For discrete color maps, each entry has a <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> value and a
<I>color</I>.  The <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> settings are either numbers within the
range of values or <I>lo</I> can be <I>min</I> or <I>hi</I> can be <I>max</I>.  The <I>lo</I>
and <I>hi</I> settings of the last entry must be <I>min</I> and <I>max</I>.  Other
entries can have any <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values and the sub-ranges of
different values can overlap.  Note that numeric <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> values
can be specified either as absolute numbers or as fractions (0.0 to
1.0) of the range, depending on the "a" or "f" in the style setting
for the color map.
</P>
<P>Here is how the entries are used to determine the color of an
individual object, given the value X of its attribute.  The entries
are scanned from first to last.  The first time that <I>lo</I> <= X <=
<I>hi</I>, X is assigned the color associated with that entry.  You can
think of the last entry as assigning a default color (since it will
always be matched by X), and the earlier entries as colors that
override the default.  Also note that no interpolation of a color RGB
is done.  All objects will be drawn with one of the colors in the list
of entries.
</P>
<P>For sequential color maps, each entry has only a <I>color</I>.  Here is how
the entries are used to determine the color of an individual object,
given the value X of its attribute.  The range is partitioned into N
bins of width <I>binsize</I>.  Thus X will fall in a specific bin from 1 to
N, say the Mth bin.  If it falls on a boundary between 2 bins, it is
considered to be in the higher of the 2 bins.  Each bin is assigned a
color from the E entries.  If E < N, then the colors are repeated.
For example if 2 entries with colors red and green are specified, then
the odd numbered bins will be red and the even bins green.  The color
of the object is the color of its bin.  Note that the sequential
color map is really a shorthand way of defining a discrete color map
without having to specify where all the bin boundaries are.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>color</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command to define a new color name, in addition to the 140-predefined
colors (see below), and associates 3 red/green/blue RGB values with
that color name.  The color name can then be used with any other
dump_modify keyword that takes a color name as a value.  The RGB
values should each be floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0
inclusive.
</P>
<P>When a color name is converted to RGB values, the user-defined color
names are searched first, then the 140 pre-defined color names.  This
means you can also use the <I>color</I> keyword to overwrite one of the
pre-defined color names with new RBG values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>gcolor</I> keyword can be used one or more times with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command, only when its grid color setting is
<I>proc</I>, to set the color that grid cells will be drawn in the image.
</P>
<P>The <I>proc</I> setting should be an integer from 1 to Nprocs = the number
of processors.  A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in
conjunction with the <I>proc</I> argument to specify a range of processor
IDs.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the
number of processors, then an asterisk with no numeric values means
all procs from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all procs from 1 to n
(inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all procs from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all procs from m to n
(inclusive).  Note that for this command, processor IDs range from 1
to Nprocs inclusive, instead of the more customary 0 to Nprocs-1.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can be a single color which is any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the
dump_modify color option.  Or it can be two or more colors separated
by a "/" character, e.g. red/green/blue.  In the former case, that
color is assigned to all the specified processors.  In the latter
case, the list of colors are assigned in a round-robin fashion to each
of the specified processors.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>glinecolor</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command to set the color of the grid cell
outlines drawn around the grid cells in each image.  See the "dump
image gline" command for how to specify that cell outlines be drawn.

<I>type</I> or <I>procs</I>, to set the color that particles will be drawn in
the image.
</P>
<P>If the particle color setting is <I>type</I>, then the specified <I>type</I> for the
<I>pcolor</I> keyword should be an integer from 1 to Ntypes = the number of
particle types.  A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in
conjunction with the <I>type</I> argument to specify a range of particle
types.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the
number of particle types, then an asterisk with no numeric values
means all types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from
1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).
</P>
<P>If the particle color setting is <I>proc</I>, then the specified <I>type</I> for the
<I>pcolor</I> keyword should be an integer from 1 to Nprocs = the number of
processors.  A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in
conjunction with the <I>type</I> argument to specify a range of processor
IDs, just as described above for particle types.  Note that for this
command, processor IDs range from 1 to Nprocs inclusive, instead of
the more customary 0 to Nprocs-1.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>color</I> can be a single color which is any of the 140
pre-defined colors (see below) or a color name defined by the

<P>The <I>pdiam</I> keyword can be used with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A>
command, when its particle diameter setting is <I>type</I>, to set the size
that particles of each type will be drawn in the image.  The specified
<I>type</I> should be an integer from 1 to Ntypes.  As with the <I>pcolor</I>
keyword, a wildcard asterisk can be used as part of the <I>type</I>
argument to specify a range of particle types.  The specified <I>diam</I>
is the size in whatever distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> the input script
is using.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>scolor</I> keyword can be used one or more times with the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump

setting is <I>one</I> or <I>proc</I>, to set the color that surface elements
will be drawn in the image.
</P>
<P>When the surf color is <I>one</I>, the <I>proc</I> setting for this command
is ignored.
</P>
<P>When the surf color is <I>proc</I>, the <I>proc</I> setting for this command

<P>These are the 140 colors that SPARTA pre-defines for use with the
<A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> and dump_modify commands.  Additional
colors can be defined with the dump_modify color command.  The 3
numbers listed for each name are the RGB (red/green/blue) values.
Divide each value by 255 to get the equivalent 0.0 to 1.0 value.
