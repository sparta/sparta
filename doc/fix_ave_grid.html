<P>These commands will dump standard averages for each species and each

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Use one or more per-grid vectors as inputs every few timesteps, and
average them grid cell by grid cell over longer timescales, applying
appropriate normalization factors.  The resulting per grid cell
averages can be used by other output commands such as the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each input value can be the result of a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> or the evaluation of a grid-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.  The compute, fix, or variable must produce
a per-grid vector or array, not a global quantity or per-molecule
quantity.  If you wish to time-average global quantities from a
compute, fix, or variable, then see the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> command.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "compute.html">Computes</A> that produce per-grid vectors or arrays are
those which have the word <I>grid</I> in their style name.  See the doc
pages for individual <A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A> to determine which ones produce
per-grid vectors or arrays.  <A HREF = "variable.html">Variables</A> of style <I>grid</I>
are the only ones that can be used with this fix since they produce
per-grid vectors.
</P>
<P>Each per-grid value of each input vector is averaged independently.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>Nevery</I>, <I>Nrepeat</I>, and <I>Nfreq</I> arguments specify on what
timesteps the input values will be used in order to contribute to the
average.  The final averaged quantities are generated on timesteps
that are a multiple of <I>Nfreq</I>.  The average is over <I>Nrepeat</I>
quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the simulation every
<I>Nevery</I> timesteps.  <I>Nfreq</I> must be a multiple of <I>Nevery</I> and
<I>Nevery</I> must be non-zero even if <I>Nrepeat</I> is 1.  Also, the timesteps
contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nfreq >
(Nrepeat-1)*Nevery is required.
</P>
<P>For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the compute calculates a per-grid vector, then the
per-grid vector is used.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column
per-grid array calculated by the compute.  If <I>c_ID</I> is used, and the
compute calculates a per-grid array, then it is the same as if the
individual columns of the array had been listed one by one.
</P>
<P>E.g. these 2 fix ave/grid commands are equivalent, since the compute
grid command produces 7 columns of output using the <I>all</I> mixture-ID
which has a single group:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid all n u v w usq vsq wsq
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1[1] c_1[2] c_1[3] c_1[4] c_1[5] c_1[6] c_1[7] 
</PRE>
<P>Users can also write code for their own compute styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them
to SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the fix calculates a per-grid vector, then the per-grid
vector is used.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N must be in the range
from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column per-grid array
calculated by the fix.  If <I>f_ID</I> is used, and the fix calculates a
per-grid array, then it is the same as if the individual columns of
the array had been listed one by one.  See the example above for
computes.
</P>
<P>Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps,
which must be compatible with <I>Nevery</I>, else an error will result.
Users can also write code for their own fix styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them to
SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script as a <A HREF = "variable.html">grid-style
variable</A> Variables of style <I>grid</I> can reference
thermodynamic keywords, or invoke other computes, fixes, or variables
when they are evaluated, so this is a very general means of generating
per-grid quantities to time average.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix. 
</P>
<P>The <I>ave</I> keyword determines what happens to the accumulation of
statistics every <I>Nfreq</I> timesteps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>one</I>, then the values produced on timesteps
that are multiples of Nfreq are independent of each other.  Normalization
(as described above) is performed, and all tallies are zeroed before
accumulating over the next <I>Nfreq</I> steps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>running</I>, then tallies are never zeroed.
Thus the output at any <I>Nfreq</I> timestep is normalized over all
previously accumulated samples since the fix was defined.  The tallies
can only be zeroed by deleting the fix via the unfix command, or by
re-defining the fix, or by re-specifying it.
</P>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.
</P>
<P>This fix produces a per-grid vector or array which can be accessed by
various output commands.  A vector is produced if only a single
quantity is averaged by this fix.  If two or more quantities are
averaged, then an array of values is produced, where the number of
columns is the number of quantities averaged.  The per-grid values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of <I>Nfreq</I> since that
is when averaging is performed.
