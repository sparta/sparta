dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.grid id f_1[*] 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Use one or more per-grid vectors as inputs every few timesteps, and
average by grid cell over longer timescales, applying appropriate
normalization factors.  The resulting per grid cell averages can be
used by other output commands such as the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A>
command.  Only grid cells in the grid group specified by <I>group-ID</I>
are included in the averaging.  See the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A>
command for info on how grid cells can be assigned to grid
groups.
</P>
<P>Each input value can be the result of a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> or <A HREF = "variable.html">grid-style variable</A>.  The compute or
fix must produce a per-grid vector or array, not a global or
per-particle or per-surf quantity.  If you wish to time-average global
quantities from a compute, fix, or variable, then see the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> command.  To time-average per-surf
quantities, see the <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix ave/surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each per-grid value of each input vector is averaged independently.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "compute.html">Computes</A> that produce per-grid vectors or arrays are
those which have the word <I>grid</I> in their style name.  See the doc
pages for individual <A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A> to determine which ones produce
per-grid vectors or arrays. 
</P>
<P>Note that for values from a compute or fix, the bracketed index I can
be specified using a wildcard asterisk with the index to effectively
specify multiple values.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or
"m*n".  If N = the size of the vector (for <I>mode</I> = scalar) or the
number of columns in the array (for <I>mode</I> = vector), then an asterisk
with no numeric values means all indices from 1 to N.  A leading
asterisk means all indices from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing
asterisk means all indices from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk
means all indices from m to n (inclusive).
</P>
<P>Using a wildcard is the same as if the individual columns of the array
had been listed one by one.  E.g. these 2 fix ave/grid commands are
equivalent, since the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A> command creates
a per-grid array with 3 columns:

<P>The <I>Nevery</I>, <I>Nrepeat</I>, and <I>Nfreq</I> arguments specify on what
timesteps the input values will be used in order to contribute to the
average.  The final averaged quantities are generated on timesteps
that are a multiple of <I>Nfreq</I>.  The average is over <I>Nrepeat</I>
quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the simulation every
<I>Nevery</I> timesteps.  <I>Nfreq</I> must be a multiple of <I>Nevery</I> and
<I>Nevery</I> must be non-zero even if <I>Nrepeat</I> is 1.  Also, the timesteps
contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nfreq >
(Nrepeat-1)*Nevery is required.
</P>
<P>For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the compute calculates a per-grid vector, then the
per-grid vector is used.  If <I>c_ID[I]</I> is used, then I must be in
the range from 1-M, which will use the Ith column of the M-column
per-grid array calculated by the compute.  See the discussion above
for how I can be specified with a wildcard asterisk to effectively
specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>Users can also write code for their own compute styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them
to SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the fix calculates a per-grid vector, then the per-grid
vector is used.  If <I>f_ID[I]</I> is used, then I must be in the range
from 1-M, which will use the Ith column of the M-column per-grid array
calculated by the fix.  See the discussion above for how I can be
specified with a wildcard asterisk to effectively specify multiple
values.
</P>
<P>Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps,
which must be compatible with <I>Nevery</I>, else an error will result.
Users can also write code for their own fix styles and <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">add them to
SPARTA</A>.
</P>
<P>If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script.  Only grid-style
variables can be referenced.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command
for details.  Note that grid-style variables define a formula which
can reference <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A> keywords, or they can
invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so
this is a very general means of specifying quantities to time average.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For averaging of a value that comes from a compute or fix,
normalization is performed as follows.  Note that no normalization is
performed on a value produced by a grid-style variable.
</P>
<P>If the compute or fix is summing over particles in a grid cell to
calculate a per-grid quantity (e.g. energy or temperature), this takes
the form of a numerator divided by a denominator.  For example, see
the formulas discussed on the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A> doc
page, where the denominator is 1 (for keyword n), or the number of
particles (ke, mass, temp), or the sum of particle masses (u, usq,
etc).  When this command averages over a series of timesteps, the
numerator and denominator are summed separately.  This means the
numerator/denominator division only takes place when this fix produces
output, every Nfreq timesteps.
</P>
<P>For example, say the Nfreq output is over 2 timesteps, and the value
produced by <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid mass</A> is being averaged.
Say a grid cell has 10 particles on the 1st timestep with a numerator
value of 10.0, and 100 particles on the 2nd timestep with a numerator
value of 50.0.  The output of this fix will be (10+50) / (10+100) =
0.54, not ((10/10) + (50/100)) / 2 = 0.75.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix. 
</P>
<P>The <I>ave</I> keyword determines what happens to the accumulation of
statistics every <I>Nfreq</I> timesteps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>one</I>, then the values produced on timesteps
that are multiples of Nfreq are independent of each other.
Normalization as described above is performed, and all tallies are
zeroed before accumulating over the next <I>Nfreq</I> steps.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ave</I> setting is <I>running</I>, then tallies are never zeroed.
Thus the output at any <I>Nfreq</I> timestep is normalized over all
previously accumulated samples since the fix was defined.  The tallies
can only be zeroed by deleting the fix via the unfix command, or by
re-defining the fix, or by re-specifying it.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix produces a per-grid vector or array which can be accessed by
various output commands.  A vector is produced if only a single
quantity is averaged by this fix.  If two or more quantities are
averaged, then an array of values is produced, where the number of
columns is the number of quantities averaged.  The per-grid values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of <I>Nfreq</I> since that
is when averaging is performed.
</P>
<P>This fix performs averaging for all child grid cells in the
simulation, which includes unsplit, split, and sub cells.  <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_">Section
4.8</A> of the manual gives details of how
SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
</P>
<P>Grid cells not in the specified <I>group-ID</I> will output zeroes for all
their values.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>If performing on-the-fly grid adaptation every N timesteps, using the
<A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix adapt</A> command, this fix cannot time-average
across time windows > N steps, since the grid may change.  This means
<I>Nfreq</I> cannot be > N, and keyword <I>ave</I> = <I>running</I> is not allowed.
