<H3>fix lammps command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID lammps group-ID Nevery source 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>lammps = style name of this fix command 

<LI>group-ID = group ID for which grid cells to consider  

<LI>Nevery = couple to LAMMPS once every Nevery steps 

<LI>source = computeID 

<PRE>  computeID = c_ID for a compute that calculates per grid number density values 
</UL></PRE>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Concurrently couple a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to SPARTA. 
This command will invoke an instance of the MD software package 
<A HREF = "https://lammps.org">LAMMPS</A> every Nevery steps. It automatically 
translates DSMC properties to a classical molecular dynamics domain, 
requiring the per-grid number density as an additional input. A 
user-defined group of cells can be selected for coupling.
</P>
<P>This fix creates an MD simulation based on the current state of the
SPARTA simulation as described in <A HREF = "#Linke25">(Linke25)</A>. A brief video
introduction can be viewed <A HREF = "https://youtu.be/-KR9Ebh1xWY">here</A>. The fix
accesses the position and velocity of particles and decomposes them into
atoms with no restriction to fnum. Based on the provided group-ID, one or 
more cells are coupled to MD and atomistic information is calculated. 
The insights are automatically passed back to SPARTA and the simulation 
continues.
</P>
<P>Note that this fix requires knowledge of molecular dynamics. To adjust
the MD simulation, you must edit the LAMMPS input script constructed 
in the Lifting operator in src/fix_lammps.cpp. To adjust the 
information passed from the MD to the DSMC domain, you must edit the 
Restricting operator in src/fix_lammps.cpp. 
</P>
<P>In its provided form, fix lammps calculates the temperature of a nickel 
surface in an air flow. The temperature is passed back to SPARTA for a 
more accurate surface-flow interaction. See the examples/couple 
directory for input scripts that use this fix.
</P>
<P>Note that this fix can be run in parallel. For parallel runs, the MD instance
will inherit all procs for the MD simulation.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>group-ID</I> must be the name of a grid cell group,
as defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A> command, which contains a
set of grid cells.
</P>
<P>The specfied <I>Nevery</I> determines how often the DSMC-MD coupling
takes place.
</P>
<P>The <I>source</I> is a per-grid quantity calculated by a
compute, such as the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A> command. It must
calculate the number density of all cells.
</P>
<HR>

<P>This fix requires a shared library instance of LAMMPS. The following steps 
achieve a working version of the coupled DSMC-MD framework. First, the LAMMPS 
code needs to be copied into the sparta/lib directory. An easy way to 
accomplish this is by navigating into sparta/lib and running
"git clone -b release https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git lammps". 
The instance must be named "lammps". 
</P>
<P>Then, if using CMake, do:
1. cd sparta/lib/lammps
2. mkdir build; cd build
3. cmake -D PKG_MANYBODY=on -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes ../cmake
4. make -j
5. cd ../../../build
6. cmake -D PKG_COUPLE=ON ../cmake
7. make -j
</P>
<P>If using GNU Make, do:
1. cd sparta/lib/lammps/src
2. make yes-manybody
3. make mode=shared mpi -j
4. cd ../../../src
5. make yes-couple
6. make mpi -j
Note that if you use a custom makefile, it must include the command 
"include Makefile.package".
</P>
<P>The examples/couple directory can test the setup. Should errors occur for either LAMMPS or SPARTA, then they will be shown in
their respective log files. 
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>However, in its provided formulation, this fix defines a custom surface 
attribute that is written to the restart file.  Namely the 
floating-point vector of temperature values for each surface with the 
name <I>temperature</I>.  As explained on the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> 
doc page these values will be re-assigned to surface when a restart file
is read.  If a new fix lammps command is specified in the restart
script as well as a surface collision model which uses the custom
attribute updated by this fix, then the per-surf temperatures and
updating process will continue to be used in the continued run.
</P>
<P>No global or per-surf quantities are stored by this fix for access by
various output commands.
</P>
<P>However, the per-surf attribute defined by this fix can be
accessed by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump surf</A> command, as s_temperature.  That means
those per-surf values can be written to surface dump files. See the 
examples/couple directory for an input script where this is shown.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>In its provided formulation, this fix can only be used to calculate the
temperature of a nickel surface in an air flow. However, this fix provides
the framework that allows for easy adaptation to the specific needs of a 
coupled DSMC-MD simulation. Templates for various adjustments can be found in
src/fix_lammps.cpp.
