[Description:]

Create particles and add them to the simulation domain.  The
attributes of individual particles, such as species and velocity, are
determined by the mixture attributes, as specied by the {mix-ID}.  In
particular the {temp}, {trot}, {tvib}, and {vstream} attributes of the
mixture affect create particle velocities and internal energy modes.
See the "mixture"_mixture.html command for more details.  Note that
this command can be used multiple times to add more and more
particles.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When a particle is created at a specified temperature
(as set by the "mixture"_mixture.html command), it's rotational and
vibrational energy will also be initialized, consistent with the
corresponding mixture temperatures.  The {rotate} and {vibrate}
options of the "collide_modify"_collide_modify.html command determine
how internal energy modes are initialized.  If the
"collide"_collide.html command has not yet been specified, then no
rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to created
particles.  Thus if you wish to create particles with non-zero
internal energy, the "collide"_collide.html and (optionally)
"collide_modify"_collide_modify.html commands must be used before this
command.

If the {n} style is used with {Np} = 0, then the number of created
particles is calculated by SPARTA as a function of the global {fnum}
value, the mixture number density, and the flow volume of the
simulation domain.

The {fnum} value is set by the "global fnum"_global.html command.  The
mixture {nrho} is set by the "mixture"_mixture.html command.  The flow
volume of the simulation is the total volume of the simulation domain
as specified by the "create_box"_create_box.html command, minus any
volume that is interior to surfaces defined by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  Note that the flow volume
includes volume contributions from grid cells cut by surfaces.
However particles are only created in grid cells entirely external to
surfaces.  This means that particles may be created in external cells
at a (slightly) higher density to compensate for no particles being
created in cut cells that still contribute to the overall flow volume.

If the {n} style is used with a non-zero {Np}, then exactly {Np}
particles are created, which can be useful for debugging or
benchmarking purposes.

Based on the value of {Np}, each grid cell will have a target number
of particles {M} to insert, which is a function of the cell's flow
volume as compared to the total system flow volume.  If {M} has a
fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will be inserted, and a
13th depending on the outcome of a random number generation.  As grid
cells are looped over, the remainder fraction is accumulated, so that
exactly {Np} particles are created across all the processors.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The preceeding calculation is actually done using
{weighted} cell volumes.  Grid cells can be weighted using the "global
weight"_global.html command.

Each particle is inserted at a random location within the grid cell.
The particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the {frac}
settings of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.  The velocity of the particle is set
to the sum of the streaming velocity of the mixture and a thermal
velocity sampled from the thermal temperature of the mixture.  Both
the streaming velocity and thermal temperature are also set by the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.  The internal rotational and
vibrational energies of the particle are also set based on the {trot}
and {tvib} settings for the mixture, as explained above.  These
default values based on the mixture properties can be overridden by
keywords explained below.

The {single} style creates a single particle.  This can be useful for
debugging purposes, e.g. to advect a single particle towards a
surface.  A single particle of the specified species is inserted at
the specified position and with the specified velocity.  In this case
the {mix-ID} is ignored.

The meaning of the optional keywords are described in the subsequent
sub-sections.

:line

The {cut} keyword controls how grid cells cut by surfaces are treated.
If {yes} is specified (the default) then particles are added to the
flow portion of those cells (outside the surfaces).  If {no} is
specified, then particles are only created in grid cells which are
entirely external to surfaces, not in grid cells cut by surfaces.

The {global} keyword only applies when the {n} style is used, and
controls how particles are generated in parallel.

If the value is {yes}, then every processor loops over all {Np}
particles.  As the coordinates of each is generated, each processor
checks what grid cell it is in, and only stores the particle if it
owns that grid cell.  Thus an identical set of particles are created,
no matter how many processors are running the simulation

IMPORTANT NOTE: The {global} yes option is not yet implemented.

If the value is {no}, then each of the {P} processors generates a
{N/P} subset of particles, using its own random number generation.  It
only adds particles to grid cells that it owns, as described above.
This is a faster way to generate a large number of particles, but
means that the individual attributes of particles will depend on the
number of processors and the mapping of grid cells to procesors.  The
overall set of created particles should have the same statistical
properties as with the {yes} setting.

If the {region} keyword is used, then a particle will only added if
its position is within the specified {region-ID}.  This can be used to
only allow particle insertion within a subset of the simulation
domain.  Note that the {side} option for the "region"_region.html
command can be used to define whether the inside or outside of the
geometric region is considered to be "in" the region.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If the {region} and {n} keywords are used together,
less than N particles may be added.  This is because grid cells will
be candidates for particle insertion, unless they are entirely outside
the bounding box that encloses the region.  Particles those grid cells
attempt to add are included in the count for N, even if some or all of
the particle insertions are rejected due to not being inside the
region.

:line

The {species}, {density}, {temp}, and {vstream} keywords can be used
to create particles with properties which are spatially dependent.
This is done by defined "equal-style variables"_variable.html with
formulas that include the coordinates of the created particle or the
coordinates of the grid cell containing the particle.

The formulas for these 4 keywords should be in the following form,
where (x,y,z) are the coordinates of the created particle, and
(cx,cy,cz) are the coordinates of the center point of the grid cell
the particle is in.

species formula = f(x,y,z) produces an integer from 1 to Nspecies
density = f(cx,cy,cz) produces a unitless scale factor
temp = f(x,y,z) = produces a unitless scale factor
vstream = 3 formulas for vx,vy,vz = vx(x,y,z) (and vy,vz) produces a value in velocity units :ul

Note that the {species}, {temp}, {vstream} keywords define particle
attributes based on the position of an individual particle.  This is
in contrast to the {custom nrho}, {custom temp}, {custom vstream}, and
{custom fractions} keywords described below, which define particle
attributes at the resolution of individual grid cells.  The {density}
keyword is similar to the {custom nrho} keyword, in that it operates
on individual grid cells.

The {species} keyword can be used to create particles with a
spatially-dependent separation of species.  The specified {svar} is
the name of an "equal-style variable"_variable.html whose formula
should evaluate to a species type, i.e. an integer from 1 to Nsp,
where Nsp is the number of species in the mixture with mix-ID.  Since
equal-style variables evaluate to floating-point values, this value is
truncated to an integer value.  The formula for the species variable
can use one or two or three variables which will store the x, y, or z
coordinates of the particle that is being created.  If used, these
variables must be "internal-style variables"_variable.html defined in
the input script; their initial numeric values can be anything.  They
must be internal-style variables, because this command resets their
values directly.  Their names are specified as {xvar}, {yvar}, and
{zvar}.  If any of them is not used in the {svar} formula, it can be
specified as NULL.

When a particle is added, its coordinates are stored in the {xvar},
{yvar}, {zvar} variables if they are specified.  The {svar} variable
is then evaluated.  The returned value is used to set the species of
that particle, based on the list of species defined for the mixture.
If the returned value is <= 0 or greater than Nsp = the number of
species in the mixture, then no particle is created.

As an example, these commands can be used in a 2d simulation, to
create a particle distribution with species 1 on top of species 2 with
a sinudoidal interface between the two species, as illustrated in the
snapshot of the initial particle distribution.  Click on the image for
a larger version.  Note that when using this option less than the
requested N particles can be created if the species variable returns
values <= 0 or greater than Nsp = the number of species in the
mixture.

variable x internal 0
variable y internal 0
variable n equal 3
variable s equal "(v_y < 0.5*(ylo+yhi) + 0.15*yhi*sin(2*PI*v_n*v_x/xhi)) + 1"
create_particles species n 10000 species s x y NULL :pre

:c,image(JPG/species_variation_small.jpg,JPG/species_variation.jpg)

The {density} keyword can be used to create particles with a
spatially-dependent density variation.  The specified {dvar} is the
name of an "equal-style variable"_variable.html whose formula should
evaluate to a positive value.  The formula for {dvar} can use one or
two or three variables which will store the x, y, or z coordinates of
the geometric center point of a grid cell.  If used, these other
variables must be "internal-style variables"_variable.html defined in
the input script; their initial numeric values can by anything.  Their
names are specified as {xvar}, {yvar}, and {zvar}.  If any of them is
not used in the {dvar} formula, it can be specified as NULL.

When particles are added to a grid cell, its center point coordinates
are stored in {xvar}, {yvar}, {zvar} if they are defined.  The {dvar}
variable is then evaluated.  The returned value is used as a scale
factor on the number of particles to create in that grid cell.  Thus a
value of 0.5 would create half as many particles in that grid cell as
would otherwise be the case, due either to the global {fnum} and
mixture {nrho} settings that define the density or due to the
specified {Np > 0} value, as explained above.  A value of 1.2 would
create 20% more particles in that grid cell.

As an example, these commands can be used in a 2d simulation, to
create more particles towards the upper right corner of the domain and
less towards the lower left corner, as illustrated in the snapshot of
the initial particle distribution.  Click on the image for a larger
version.  Note that less than requested N particles will be created in
this case because all the scale factors generated by the variable {d}
are less than 1.0.

variable x internal 0
variable y internal 0
variable d equal "v_x/xhi * v_y/yhi"
create_particles air n 10000 density d x y NULL :pre

:c,image(JPG/density_variation_small.jpg,JPG/density_variation.jpg)

The {temperature} keyword can be used to create particles with a
spatially-dependent thermal temperature variation.  The specified
{tvar} is the name of an "equal-style variable"_variable.html whose
formula should evaluate to a positive value.  The formula for the
{tvar} variable can use one or two or three variables which will store
the x, y, or z coordinates of the geometric center point of a grid
cell.  If used, these other variables must be "internal-style
variables"_variable.html defined in the input script; their initial
numeric values can by anything.  Their names are specified as {xvar},
{yvar}, and {zvar}.  If any of them is not used in the {tvar} formula,
it can be specified as NULL.

When a particle is created, its coordinates are stored in {xvar},
{yvar}, {zvar} if they are defined.  The {tvar} variable is then
evaluated.  The returned value is used as a scale factor on all 3
mixture temperatures (thermal, rotational, vibrational) used to
initialize the particle's velocity and internal energies, as explained
above.  Thus a value of 0.5 would create particles using temperatures
half of what the mixture specifies.  A value of 1.2 would create
particles using 20% higher temperatures.

As an example, these commands can be used in a 2d simulation, to
create a thermal temperature gradient in x, where the temperature on
the left side of the box is the default value, and the temperature on
the right side is 3x larger.

variable x internal 0
variable t equal "1.0 + 2.0*(v_x-xlo)/(xhi-xlo)"
create_particles air n 10000 temperature t x NULL NULL :pre

The {vstream} keyword can be used to create particles with a
spatially-dependent streaming velocity.  The specified {vxvar},
{vyvar}, {vzvar} are the names of "equal-style
variables"_variable.html whose formulas should evaluate to the
corresponding component of the streaming velocity.  If any of them are
specified as NULL, then that streaming velocity component is set by
the corresponding mixture streaming velocity component, the same as if
the {vstream} keyword were not used.

The formulas for the {vxvar}, {vyvar}, {vzvar} variables can use one
or two or three variables which will store the x, y, or z coordinates
of the particle that is being created.  If used, these other variables
must be "internal-style variables"_variable.html defined in the input
script; their initial numeric values can by anything.  Their names are
specified as {xvar}, {yvar}, and {zvar}.  If any of them is not used
in the {vxvar}, {vyvar}, {vzvar} formulas, it can be specified as
NULL.

When a particle is added, its coordinates are stored in {xvar},
{yvar}, {zvar} if they are defined.  The {vxvar}, {vyvar}, {vzvar}
variables are then evaluated.  The returned values are used to set the
streaming velocity of that particle.  A thermal velocity is also added
to the particle, using the temperature set by the mixture or {temp}
keyword, as described above.

As an example, these commands can be used in a 2d simulation, to give
particles an initial velocity pointing towards the upper right corner
of the domain with a magnitude that makes them all reach that point at
the same time (assuming their thermal velocity is small and it is not
a collisional flow).  Click on the image to play an animation of the
effect.

variable x internal 0
variable y internal 0
variable vx equal (xhi-v_x)/(1000*7.0e-9)  # timesteps and timestep-size
variable vy equal (yhi-v_y)/(1000*7.0e-9)
create_particles air n 10000 velocity vx vy NULL x y NULL :pre

:line

The {custom} keyword can be used one or more times to tailor the
attributes of created particles within individual grid cells.  This is
done by using custom per-grid vectors or arrays defined by other
commands.

For example, the "read_grid"_read_grid.html command can read per-grid
attributes included in a grid data file.  The "custom"_custom.html
command allows for definition of custom per-grid vectors or arrays and
their initialization by use of "grid-style variables"_variable.html or
by reading the values from a file.

See "Section Howto 6.17"_Section_howto.html#howto_17 for a discussion
of custom per-grid attributes.

The {attribute} values of the {custom} keyword can be any of the
following:

nrho = number density (# per volume or area units) = per-grid vector
temp = temperature (temperature units) = per-grid vector
vstream = 3-component streaming velocity (velocity units) = per-grid array with 3 columns
fractions = species fractions (unitless) = per-grid array :ul

The {g_name} value of the {custom} keyword is the name of the custom
per-grid vector or array.  It must store floating-point values and be
a vector or array, as indicated in the list above.

Note that the {custom} keyword defines particle attributes at the
resolution of individual grid cells.  This is in contrast to the
{species}, {temp}, {vstream} keywords described above, which can
define particle attributes based on the position of an individual
particle.  The {custom density} keyword is similar to the {nrho}
keyword, in that it operates on individual grid cells.

The {custom} attribute {nrho} sets a number density for each grid cell
from a per-grid custom vector.  The values are used to calculate the
count of particles created within each grid cell.  The nrho values
should be in per-volume units = per-length^3 for 3d models or
axisymmetric models.  The values should be in per-area units =
per-length^2 for 2d models.

Note that if {Np} = 0, then the custom {nrho} value effectively
increases or decreases the number of particles created in a cell by
the scale factor custom_rho/mixture_nrho.  As compared to the number
created if the {custom nrho} keyword were not used.  If {Np} > 0, the
number of particles created in a cell is increased or decreased by the
same scale factor custom_nrho/mixture_nrho, only now the scale factor
is applied to the count of particles for the grid cell calculated as
explained above when {Np} > 0.

The {custom} attribute {temp} sets a temperature for each grid cell
from a per-grid vector.  This temperature is divided by the mixture
thermal temperature to calculate a scale factor.  The scale factor is
applied to all 3 mixture temperatures (thermal, rotational,
vibrational) used to initialize the velocity and internal energies, as
explained above, for each particle created in the grid cell.  Thus a
scale factor of 0.5 would create particles using temperatures half of
what the mixture specifies.  A value of 1.2 would create particles
using 20% higher temperatures.

The {custom} attribute {vstream} sets a streaming velocity for
particles created in each grid cell from a 3-column per-grid custom
array.

The {custom} attribute {fractions} sets the relative species fractions
for each grid cell from an N-column per-grid custom array, where N is
the number of species in the mixture specified with this command.  For
each grid cell, the N values will be used to set the relative
fractions of created particles in that cell.

For each grid cell, the N per-species fractional values must sum to
1.0.  However, one or more of the numeric values can be < zero, say M
of them.  In this case, each of the M values will be reset to (1 -
sum)/M, where sum is the sum of the N-M values which are >= zero.

Note that the ordering of species within the N columns of the custom
per-grid array, is the same as the order of species within the mix-ID
mixture.  This is determined by the "mixture"_mixture.html command.
It is the order the gas species names were listed when the mixture
command was specified (one or more times).

:line

The {twopass} keyword does not require a value.  If used, the
creation procedure will loop over the creation grid cells twice, the
same as the KOKKOS package version of this command does, so that it can
reallocate memory efficiently, e.g. on a GPU.  If this keyword is used
the non-KOKKOS and KOKKOS version will generate exactly the same set
of particles, which makes debugging easier.  If the keyword is not
used, the non-KOKKOS and KOKKOS runs will use random numbers
differently and thus generate different particles, though they will be
statistically similar.

:line

This command (or more generically styles) can take a suffix as shown
at the top of this page.

Styles with a {kk} suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
"Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the "Making
SPARTA"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.

[Restrictions:]

The keywords {density} and {custom nrho} cannot both be used.  This is
because they are both methods for setting the number of particles
created.  Ditto for {temperature} amd {custom temp}.  Ditto for
{vstream} and {custom vstream}.  Ditto for {species} and {custom
fractions}.
