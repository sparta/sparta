<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set parameters that affect how collisions are performed.
</P>
<P>The <I>vremax</I> keyword affects how often the Vremax parameter, for
collision frequency is re-zeroed during the simulation.  This
parameter is stored for each grid cell and each pair of collision
groups (groups are described by the <A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command).
</P>
<P>The value of Vremax affects how many events are attempted in each grid
cell for a pair of groups, and thus the overall time spent performing
collisions.  Vremax is continuously set to the largest difference in
velocity between a pair of colliding particles.  The larger Vremax
grows, the more collisions are attempted for the grid cell on each
timestep, though this does not affect the number of collisions
actually performed.  Thus if Vremax grows large, collisions become
less efficient, though still accurate.
</P>
<P>For non-equilibrium flows, it is typically desirable to reset Vremax
to zero fairly frequently (e.g. every 1000 steps) so that it does not
become large, due to anomolously fast moving particles.  In contrast,
when a system is at equilibrium, it is typically desirable to not
reset Vremax to zero since it will also stay roughly constant.
</P>
<P>If <I>Nevery</I> is specified as 0, Vremax is not zeroed during a run.
Otherwise Vremax is zeroed on timesteps that are a multiple of
<I>Nevery</I>.  Additionally, if <I>startflag</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, Vremax is
zeroed at the start of every run.  If it is set to <I>no</I>, it is not.
</P>
<P>The <I>remain</I> keyword affects how the number of attempted collisions
for each grid cell is calculated each timestep.  If the value is set
to <I>yes</I>, then any fractional collision count (for each grid cell and
pair of grgroups) is carried over to the next timestep.  E.g. if the
computed collision count is 7.3, then 7 attempts are made on this
timestep, and 0.3 are carried over to the next timestep, to be added
to the computed collision count for that step.  If the value is set to
<I>no</I>, then no carry-over is made.  Instead, in this example, 7
attempts are made and an 8th attempt is made conditionally with a
probability of 0.3, using a random number.
</P>
<P>The <I>nearcp</I> keyword stands for "near collision partner" and affects
how collision partners are selected.  If <I>no</I> is specified, which is
the default, then collision partner pairs are selected randomly from
all particles in the grid cell.  In this case the <I>Nlimit</I> parameter
is ignored, though it must still be specfied.  
</P>
<P>If <I>yes</I> is specified, then up to <I>Nlimit</I> collision partners are
considered for each collision.  The first partner I is chosen randomly
from all particles in the grid cell.  A distance R that particle I
moves in that timestep is calculated, based on its velocity.  <I>Nlimit</I>
possible collision partners J are examined, starting at a random J.
If one of them is within a distance R of particle I, it is immediately
selected as the collision partner.  If none of the <I>Nlimit</I> particles
are within a distance R, the closest J particle to I is selected.  An
exception to these rules is that a particle J is not considered for a
collision if the I,J pair were the most recent collision partners (in
the current timestep) for each other.  The convergence properties of
this near-neighbor algorithm are described in <A HREF = "#Gallis11">(Gallis11)</A>.
Note that choosing <I>Nlimit</I> judiciously will avoid costly searches
when there are large numbers of particles in some or all grid cells.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ambipolar</I> keyword is set to <I>yes</I>, then collisions within a
grid cell with use the ambipolar approximation.  This requires use of
the <A HREF = "fix_ambipolar.html">fix ambipolar</A> command to define which species
is an electron and which species are ions.  There can be many of the
latter.  When collisions within a single grid cell are performed, each
ambipolar ion is split into two particles, the ion and an associated
electron.  Collisions between the augmented set of particles are
calculated.  Ion/electron chemistry can also occur if the
<A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command has been used to read a file of reactions
that include such reactions.  See the <A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command doc
page.  After all collisions in the grid cell have been computed, there
is still a one-to-one correspondence between ambipolar ions and
electron, and each pair is recombined into a single ambipolar
particle.
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate</I> keyword determines how rotational energy is treated in
particle collisions and stored by particles.  If the value is set to
<I>no</I>, then rotational energy is not tracked; every particle's
rotational energy is 0.0.  If the value is set to <I>smooth</I>, a
particle's rotational energy is a single continuous value.
</P>
<P>The <I>vibrate</I> keyword determines how vibrational energy is treated in
particle collisions and stored by particles.  If the value is set to
<I>no</I>, then vibrational energy is not tracked; every particle's
vibrational energy is 0.0.  If the value is set to <I>smooth</I>, a
particle's vibrational energy is a single continuous value.  If the
value is set to <I>discrete</I>, each particle's vibrational energy is set
to discrete values, namely multiples of kT where k = the Boltzmann
constant and T is one or more characteristic vibrational temperatures
set for the particle species.
</P>
<P>Note that in the <I>discrete</I> case, if any species are defined that have
4,6,8 vibrational degrees of freedom, which correspond to 2,3,4
vibrational modes, then the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command must be
used with its optional <I>vibfile</I> keyword to set the vibrational info
(temperature, relaxation number, degeneracy) for those species.
</P>
<P>Also note that if any such species are defined (with more than one
vibrational mode, then use of the <I>discrete</I> option also requires the
<A HREF = "fix_vibmode.html">fix vibmode</A> command be used to allocate storage for
the per-particle mode values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>swpm</I> keyword enables or disables variable particle weights. 
The variable particle weight model is the stochastic weighted particle method 
(SWPM) <A HREF = "#Rjasanow05">(Rjasanow05)</A>. If <I>no</I> is specified, the DSMC model,
which is the default, is used. 
</P>
<P>If <I>yes</I> is specified, then SWPM is used. SWPM is composed of two
stages: particle splitting and particle reduction. Particle splitting
will split particles if a cell has less than <I>nsplit</I> particles. Every colliding 
pair creates two child particles so that the total number of particles after
each collision is four. Only the child particles will collide while the velocities
of the parent particles will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>The weight of the child particles are defined
by the weight transfer function, <I>G</I> where the weight of each child particle 
is set as <I>G</I>. In SPARTA, it is assumed <I>G</I> = max(<I>g_i</I>,<I>g_j</I>)/(1 + <I>gamma</I>)
where <I>g_i</I> and <I>g_j</I> are the weights of the parent particles. <I>gamma</I> is a 
value that is greater than or equal to zero.
</P>
<P>The <I>reduce</I> keyword is for the particle
reduction. Particle reduction replaces all particles in
a cell with a smaller number of particles while conserving certain physical
quantities of interest. If <I>no</I> is specificed, particle reduction is not used.
If <I>yes</I> is specified, particle reduction is used. In SPARTA, the particles
are first divided into groups and then each group of particles is reduced.
</P>
<P>Note: <I>reduce</I> can only be called after <I>swpm</I> is enabled first
</P>
<P>The <I>reduction_choice</I> keyword is either <I>energy</I>, <I>heat</I>, or <I>stress</I>.
In all choices, the mass and momentum of each group
is conserved. If <I>energy</I> is chosen, the energy of each group is conserved.
If <I>heat</I> is chosen, the energy and heat flux in each group is conserved.
If <I>stress</I> is chosen, the energy, heat flux, and stress tensor is each group
is conserved.  For the first two choices, all particles in a group are replaced
by two particles. For the last choice, all particles in a group are replaced 
by at most six particles.
</P>
<P>The <I>nreduce</I> keyword is the minimum number of particles a cell must have to
be eligible for particle reduction. If a cell has more than <I>nreduce</I> particles,
particle reduction (if enabled) is called. Otherwise, particle reduction is skipped.
<I>nreduce</I> must be greater than 2 if <I>energy</I> or <I>heat</I> reduction is used.
If <I>stress</I> reduction is used, <I>nreduce</I> must be greater than 6. 
</P>
<P>The <I>group_choice</I> keyword is either <I>binary</I> or <I>weight</I>.
Particles are grouped using a binary tree strategy. 
The root node contains all particles.
The root node is split into two leaves.
Particles are sorted into each leaf according to their velocity.
The leaf nodes recursively divide until the number of particles in that node
is less than <I>ngroup</I>.
If <I>binary</I> grouping is used, the particle are divided by comparing
their velocities with respect to a plane.
The plane has a normal in the same direction of the eigenvector corresponding 
to the largest eigenvluae of the covariance matrix of the particle velocities.
The <I>weight</I> grouping first divides the particles in the root node by weight. 
Three groups are identified: small, medium, and large weights.
Particles with large weights are not eligible to reduce.
Medium and small particles are reduced separately.
Each group is then recursively divided using the <I>binary</I> grouping. 
</P>
<P>The <I>ngroup</I> keyword is the maximum number of particles that can be in a
group before being reduced. <I>ngroup</I> must be greater than 2 if <I>energy</I> or
<I>heat</I> reduction is used. If <I>stress</I> reduction is used, <I>ngroup</I> must be
greater than 6.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The SWPM capabilities are currently limited to monoatomic, single-species gases.
</P>
<P>SWPM can be used with adaptive grids but will cause a significant increase
in the number of particles.
