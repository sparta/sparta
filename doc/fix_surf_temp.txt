fix surf/temp command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID surf/temp surf-ID Nevery source Tsurf emisurf customID :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
surf/temp = style name of this fix command :l
surf-ID = group ID for which surface elements to consider :l
Nevery = adjust surface temperature once every Nevery steps :l
source = computeID or fixID :l
  computeID = c_ID or c_ID\[n\] for a compute that calculates per surf values
  fixID = f_ID or f_ID\[n\] for a fix that calculates per surf values :pre
Tsurf = initial temperature of surface (temperature units) :l
emisurf = emissivity of the surface (unitless, 0 < emisurf <= 1)  :l
customID = name of a custom per-surf variable to create :l,ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 surf all all etot
fix 1 surf/temp all 1000 c_1 250 0.9 temperature :pre
surf_collide 1 diffuse s_temperature 0.5

[Description:]

Compute a new temperature for each surface element in the group once
every Nevery steps.  This command uses a compute or fix ID which
should compute the flux of total energy onto each surface elements,
e.g. {etot} from the "compute surf"_compute_surf.html command.  Note
that SPARTA does not check that the compute/fix specified calculates
an energy flux.

This fix creates a custom per-surf vector with the specified name of
{customID}.  It can be accessed by other commands which use the
current temperature of surface elements.  An example is the
"surf_collide diffuse"_surf_collide.html command.

The per-surface element temperatures computed by this fix can be
output via the "dump surf"_dump.html command, using the {s_name}
syntax to output the custom temparture variable created by this fix.
See the examples/adjust_temp dir for scripts that use this fix.

The specified {group-ID} must be the name of a surface element group,
as defined by the "group surf"_group.html command, which contains a
set of surface elements.

The specfied {Nevery} determines how often the surface temperatures
are re-computed.

The {source} can be specified as a per-surf quantity calculated by a
compute, such as the "compute surf"_compute_surf.html command.  Or it
can be specified a per-surf quantity calculated by a fix, e.g. one
which performs time-averaging of per-surf quantities, such as "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html.

If the specified {source} has no bracketed term appended, the compute
or fix must calculate a per-surf vector.  If {c_ID\[I\]} or
{f_ID\[I\]} is used, then I must be in the range from 1-M, which will
use the Ith column of the M-column per-surf array calculated by the
compute or fix.

The temperature of the surface element is calculated from the
Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gray-body, which states that

q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf^4 :pre

where q_wall is the heat flux to the surface (provided by the compute
or fix), sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant appropriate to the
"units"_units.html being used, {emisurf} is the surface emissivity,
and {Tsurf} is the resulting surface temperature.

The specified emissivity {emisurf} is a unitless coefficient > 0.0 and
<= 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.  An emissivity
coefficient of 1.0 means the surface is a black-body that radiates all
the energy it receives.

The specified {Tsurf} value is used to set the initial temperature of
every surface element in the system.  The temperature values for only
surface elements in the {surf-ID} group will be reset every {Nevery}
timesteps by the formula above.  The the temperature values for
surfaces not in the {surf-ID} group will always be {Tsurf}.

Note that these temperature values are stored in a custom per-surf
vector.  The commands that use these values determine whether they
access only surface element values in the {surf-ID} group or others as
well.  E.g. the "surf_collide diffuse"_surf_collide.html command can
also be assigned to a group of surface elements via the
"surf_modify"_surf_modify.html command.  If the same surface group ID
and same custom per-surf vector name is used for both surf_collide
diffuse and this command, then only surface elements with time-varying
temperatures set by this fix will be accessed for surface collision
calculations.

It is also possible to defined multiple "surf_collide
diffuse"_surf_collide.html and fix surf/temp commands could be
defined, each pair of which use a different surface group and
different custom per-surf vector name.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  We may add support for writing the custom
per-surf vector to the restart file at a later time.

[Restrictions:]

Currently this fix can only be used in simulations that define
explicit non-distributed surfaces.  Support for distributed or
implicit surfaces may be added at a later time.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
