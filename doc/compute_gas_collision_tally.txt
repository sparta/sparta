compute gas/collision/tally command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID gas/collision/tally group-ID mix-ID value1 value2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
gas/collision/tally = style name of this compute command :l
group-ID = group ID for which grid cells to perform calculation on :l
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :l
one or more values can be appended :l
value = {id/cell} or {id1} or {id2} or {type1} or {type2} or {vx1/pre} or {vy1/pre} or {vz1/pre} or {vx2/pre} or {vy2/pre} or {vz2/pre} or {vx1/post} or {vy1/post} or {vz1/post} or {vx2/post} or {vy2/post} or {vz2/post} :l
  {id/cell} = grid cell ID
  {id1}, {id2} = particle IDs of two particles
  {type1}, {type2} = particle species of two particles
  {vx1/pre}, {vy1/pre}, {vz1/pre} = velocity components of first particle before collision
  {vx2/pre}, {vy2/pre}, {vz2/pre} = velocity components of second particle before collision
  {vx1/post}, {vy1/post}, {vz1/post} = velocity components of first particle after collision
  {vx2/post}, {vy2/post}, {vz2/post} = velocity components of second particle after collision :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 gas/collision/tally all all id id/cell time xc yc zc :pre

This command will dump the tallies in the previous command to a dump
file every 10 steps:

dump 1 tally all 10 tmp.tally c_1\[*\] :pre

[Description:]

Tally various values for each gas-phase collision of two particles
during the current timestep.  Only gas collisions which do not result
in chemical reactions are tallied by this command.  See the related
"compute gas/reaction/tally"_compute_gas_reaction_tally.html command
to tally collisions which induce reactions.  It provides different
tally value options than this compute.

Only collisions within grid cells in the grid group specified by
{group-ID} and pairs of particles with both species in the mixture
specified by {mix-ID} are included.  See the "group grid"_group.html
command for info on how grid cells can be assigned to grid groups.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump tally"_dump.html command.  Currently this is the only option for
accessing the tallied values.

:line

The {id/cell} value is the ID of the grid cell in which the collision
takes place.

The {id1} and {id2} values are the IDs of the colliding particles.
Note that particle IDs are generated randomly.  Thus multiple
particles in the system can potentially have the same ID.  See
"Section 6.17"_Section_howto_17 for more details on particle IDs.

The {type1} and {type2} values are the integer index for the particle
species of the colliding particles.  They are values from 1 to
Nspecies. The values corresponds to the order in which species were
defined via the "species"_species.html command.  See "Section
6.17"_Section_howto_17 for more details on particle types.

The {vx1/pre}, {vy1/pre}, {vz1/pre}, {vx2/pre}, {vy2/pre}, {vz2/pre}
values are the velocity components of the two particles before the
collision.

The {vx1/post}, {vy1/post}, {vz1/post}, {vx2/post}, {vy2/post},
{vz2/post} values are the velocity components of the two particles
after the collision.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-tally array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-tally values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 6.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-tally array values will be in the "units"_units.html
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  All the
velocity keywords are in velocity units.
