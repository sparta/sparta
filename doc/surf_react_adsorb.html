<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a model for surface chemistry reactions to perform when
particles collide with surface elements or the global boundaries of
the simulation box, which enables the particles to adsorb to the
surface.  This model also has an option to encode chemical reactions
that can occur on the surface itself.  
</P>
<P>One or more models can be defined and assigned to different surfaces
or simulation box boundaries via the <A HREF = "surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A> or
<A HREF = "bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A> commands.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_9">Section
6.9</A> for more details of how SPARTA defines
surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d and
line segments in 2d.  Also see the <A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command for
specification of a gas-phase chemistry reaction model.
</P>
<P>The per-surface element species state computed and updated by this
command can be output via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump surf</A> command, using the
<I>s_name</I> syntax to output any of the 5 custom surface state variables
created by this surface reaction model.  They are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>nstick_species = per-surf array with per-species counts
<LI>nstick_total = per-surf vector with total count of all species
<LI>area = per-surf area vector
<LI>weight = per-surf weight vector
<LI>tau = per-surf time-counter vector (see below) 
</UL>
<P>See the examples/surf_react_adsorb dir for scripts that use this
surface reaction model.
</P>
<P>The ID for a surface reaction model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface reaction model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
</P>
<P>In this <I>adsorb</I> style, gas particles can adsorb on the surface.
Adsorbed particles can then undergo reactions with other adsorbed
particles as well as with new gas-phase particles that strike the
surface.  Each surface element stores its "state" for the counts of
different particle species currently adsorbed on the element, which
alters the probablity for future reactions to take place.
</P>
<P>When a particle adsorbs on the surface, a gas particle is deleted and
the number of adsorbed particles of that particular species is
incremented.  When a particle desorbs from the surface, a new gas
particle is created and the surface count is decremented.  The exact
location of the adsorbed particles is not stored; they are assumed to
uniformly distributed across the surface element.
</P>
<P>One of three options is specified by the <I>model</I> keyword: <I>gs</I> or <I>ps</I>
or <I>gs/ps</I>.  This specifies one of two types of reactions to perform,
or both in the <I>gs/ps</I> case.
</P>
<P>Gas-surface (GS) reactions involve both gas-phase and adsorbed/bulk
species as reactants.  Hence GS reactions occur when gas particles
collide with the surface.  Pure-surface (PS) reactions involve only
adsorbed/bulk reactants and do not include any gas-phase atoms or
molecules.  They are performed once every <I>Nsync</I> timesteps based on
the current surface coverage of the various adsorbed species.
</P>
<P>For GS reactions, when a particle collides with a surface element or
boundary, the list of all reactions possible with that species as the
reactant is looped over.  A probability for each reaction is
calculated, using the formulas discussed below, and a random number is
used to decide which reaction (if any) takes place.  A check is made
that the sum of probabilities for all possible reactions is <= 1.0,
which should normally be the case if reasonable reaction coefficients
are defined.
</P>
<P>For PS reactions, a time counter algorithm is used.  Each reaction has
a time counter <I>tau</I> that is increased by a value of <I>nsync*timestep</I>
if all the reactants are available.  The rate for each reaction <I>R</I> is
computed based on the specified reaction rate constants as well as the
surface coverage of the reactants. The product of the rate <I>R</I> and
time counter <I>tau</I> is normalized to obtain the probability for each of
reaction; and a random number is used to decide which reaction occurs.
The chosen reaction is perforemd and its time counter is modified as
follows:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/time_counter.png">
</CENTER>
<P>Next the probabilities of each reaction are recomputed and a new
reaction is chosen based on these probabilties and performed.  This
process is repeated till the probability of all the reactions reaches
zero. A detailed description can be found in Swaminathan Gopalan <I>et
al.</I> <A HREF = "#SG18">(SG18)</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The infile argument(s) specigy one or two filenames which contain a
list of GS or PS reactions and their associated parameters.  Two files
must be specified for the <I>gs/ps</I> model: a GS file first and a PS file
second.
</P>
<P>The reactions are read into SPARTA and stored as a list.  Each time a
simulation is run the list is scanned, and only active reactions are
flagged.  In order for a reaction to be active, all the reactants and
all the products must be currently defined as species-IDs; and also
all the surface reactants and products must be present within the list
of species that are allowed to adsorb on the surface.  The list of
surface species is provided at the end of the surf_react adsorb
command via the adsp1, adsp2, etc arguments.
</P>
<P>Note that this means the reaction file(s) can contain more reactions
than are used in a particular simulation.  
</P>
<P>As explained below each reaction has a specified probability between
0.0 and 1.0.  That probability is used to choose which reaction (if
any) is performed.
</P>
<P>The format of either a GS or PS reaction file is as follows.  Comments
or blank lines are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a
"#" character.  All other entries must come in 2 or more lines with
values separated by whitespace in the following format
</P>

</PRE>
<P>The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction. R1,
R2, and R3 are the reactants; while P1, P2, and P3 are the products
listed as a <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> IDs.  The phase of the reactants
and products are species in the brackets immediately following the
species ID (no space).  It can be one of the following
</P>
<PRE>(g) - gas phase = gas particle striking or scattering from the surface
(s) - surface phase = adsorbed particle present on the surface
(b) - bulk phase = material which the surface is made of 
</PRE>
<P>For a GS reaction, R1 must be a gas-phase reactant.  I.e. the particle
species that collides with the surface/boundary.  For a PS reaction,
R1 must be an adsorbed or bulk-phase species.
</P>
<P>Individual reactants and products must be separated by whitespace and
a "+" sign. The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be
separated by whitespace and "-->".  The <I>type</I> of each reaction is a
string of characters (upper or lower case).  The different types of GS
and PS reactions are described below.

<P>A collision-induced (CI) reaction means that R1(g) causes the
desorption of adsorbed species R2(s) when it collides with the
surface/boundary to form gas-phase products P1(g) (same species as
R2). The incident gas-phase particle can either adsorb P2(s) or
scatter from the surface P2(g) post collision.

<P>If there are gas-phase products, there is an option to specify the

<P>All the surface reaction models calculate a global vector of values.
The values can be used by the <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A> command

means they can be used by any command that uses a variable as input,

just the ones flagged as active for a particular simulation.
</P>
<P>The first element of the vector is the count of particles that
performed surface reactions for surface elements assigned to this
reaction model during the current timestep. The second element is the
cummulative count of particles that have performed reactions since the
