<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_1"></A><B><I>Read this first:</I></B> 

<P>Building SPARTA can be non-trivial.  You may need to edit a makefile,
there are compiler options to consider, additional libraries can be
used (MPI, JPEG).
</P>
<P>Please read this section carefully.  If you are not comfortable with
makefiles, or building codes on a Linux platform, or running an MPI
job on your machine, please find a local expert to help you.
</P>
<P>If you have a build problem that you are convinced is a SPARTA issue
(e.g. the compiler complains about a line of SPARTA source code), then
please send an email to the
<A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</A>.
</P>
<P>If you succeed in building SPARTA on a new kind of machine, for which
there isn't a similar Makefile in the src/MAKE directory, send it to
the <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</A> and we'll
include it in future SPARTA releases.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_2"></A><B><I>Steps to build a SPARTA executable:</I></B> 

<P><B>Step 0</B>
</P>
<P>The src directory contains the C++ source and header files for SPARTA.
It also contains a top-level Makefile and a MAKE sub-directory with
low-level Makefile.* files for many machines.  From within the src
directory, type "make" or "gmake".  You should see a list of available
choices.  If one of those is the machine and options you want, you can
type a command like:
</P>
<PRE>make g++
or
gmake mac 
</PRE>
<P>Note that on a multi-core platform you can launch a parallel make, by
using the "-j" switch with the make command, which will build SPARTA
more quickly.
</P>
<P>If you get no errors and an executable like spa_g++ or spa_mac is
produced, you're done; it's your lucky day.
</P>
<P><B>Step 1</B>
</P>
<P>If Step 0 did not work, you will need to create a low-level Makefile
for your machine, like Makefile.foo.  Copy an existing
src/MAKE/Makefile.* as a starting point.  The only portions of the
file you need to edit are the first line, the "compiler/linker
settings" section, and the "SPARTA-specific settings" section.
</P>
<P><B>Step 2</B>
</P>
<P>Change the first line of src/MAKE/Makefile.foo to list the word "foo"
after the "#", and whatever other options it will set.  This is the
line you will see if you just type "make".
</P>
<P><B>Step 3</B>
</P>
<P>The "compiler/linker settings" section lists compiler and linker
settings for your C++ compiler, including optimization flags.  You can
use g++, the open-source GNU compiler, which is available on all Linux
systems.  You can also use mpicc which will typically be available if
MPI is installed on your system, though you should check which actual
compiler it wraps.  Vendor compilers often produce faster code.  On
boxes with Intel CPUs, we suggest using the commercial Intel icc
compiler, which can be downloaded from <A HREF = "http://www.intel.com/software/products/noncom">Intel's compiler site</A>.
</P>


<P>If building a C++ code on your machine requires additional libraries,
then you should list them as part of the LIB variable.
</P>
<P>The DEPFLAGS setting is what triggers the C++ compiler to create a
dependency list for a source file.  This speeds re-compilation when
source (*.cpp) or header (*.h) files are edited.  Some compilers do
not support dependency file creation, or may use a different switch
than -D.  GNU g++ works with -D.  Note that when you build SPARTA for
the first time on a new platform, a long list of *.d files will be
printed out rapidly.  This is not an error; it is the Makefile doing
its normal creation of dependencies.
</P>
<P><B>Step 4</B>
</P>
<P>The "system-specific settings" section has several parts.  Note that
if you change any -D setting in this section, you should do a full
re-compile, after typing "make clean", which will describe different
clean options.
</P>
<P>The SPA_INC variable is used to include options that turn on ifdefs
within the SPARTA code.  The options that are currently recogized are:
</P>
<UL><LI>-DSPARTA_GZIP
<LI>-DSPARTA_JPEG
<LI>-DSPARTA_PNG
<LI>-DLAMMPS_FFMPEG
<LI>-DSPARTA_MAP
<LI>-DSPARTA_SMALL
<LI>-DSPARTA_BIG
<LI>-DSPARTA_BIGBIG
<LI>-DSPARTA_LONGLONG_TO_LONG 
</UL>
<P>The read_data and dump commands will read/write gzipped files if you
compile with -DSPARTA_GZIP.  It requires that your Linux support the
"popen" command.
</P>
<P>If you use -DSPARTA_JPEG and/or -DSPARTA_PNG, the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
image</A> command will be able to write out JPEG and/or PNG
image files respectively. If not, it will only be able to write out
PPM image files.  For JPEG files, you must also link SPARTA with a
JPEG library, as described below.  For PNG files, you must also link
SPARTA with a PNG library, as described below.
</P>
<P>If you use -DSPARTA_FFMPEG, the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump movie</A> command
will be available to support on-the-fly generation of rendered movies
the need to store intermediate image files.  It requires that your
machines supports the "popen" function in the standard runtime library
and that an FFmpeg executable can be found by SPARTA during the run.
</P>
<P>If you use -DSPARTA_MAP, SPARTA will use the STL map class for hash
tables.  This is less efficient than the STL unordered map class which
is not yet supported by all C++ compilers.  The default is to use the
unordered map class, so only set -DSPARTA_MAP if the build complains
that unordered maps are not recognized.
</P>
<P>Use at most one of the -DSPARTA_SMALL, -DSPARTA_BIG, -DSPARTA_BIGBIG
settings.  The default is -DSPARTA_BIG.  These refer to use of 4-byte
(small) vs 8-byte (big) integers within SPARTA, as described in
src/spatype.h.  The only reason to use the BIGBIG setting is to enable
simulation of large models with more than ~2 billion grid cells.  The
only reason to use the SMALL setting is if your machine does not
support 64-bit integers.
</P>
<P>In all cases, the size of problem that can be run on a per-processor
basis is limited by 4-byte integer storage to about 2 billion
particles per processor (2^31), which should not normally be a
restriction since such a problem would have a huge per-processor
memory and would run very slowly in terms of CPU secs/timestep.
</P>
<P>The -DSPARTA_LONGLONG_TO_LONG setting may be needed if your system or
MPI version does not recognize "long long" data types.  In this case a
"long" data type is likely already 64-bits, in which case this setting
will use that data type.
</P>
<P><B>Step 5</B>
</P>
<P>The 3 MPI variables are used to specify an MPI library to build SPARTA
with. 
</P>
<P>If you want SPARTA to run in parallel, you must have an MPI library
installed on your platform.  If you use an MPI-wrapped compiler, such
as "mpicc" to build, you should be able to leave these 3 variables
blank; the MPI wrapper knows where to find the needed files.  If not,
and MPI is installed on your system in the usual place (under
/usr/local), you also may not need to specify these 3 variables.  On
some large parallel machines which use "modules" for their
compile/link environements, you may simply need to include the correct
module in your build environment.  Or the parallel machine may have a
vendor-provided MPI which the compiler has no trouble finding.
</P>
<P>Failing this, with these 3 variables you can specify where the mpi.h
file is found (via MPI_INC), and the MPI library file is found (via
MPI_PATH), and the name of the library file (via MPI_LIB).  See
Makefile.serial for an example of how this can be done.
</P>
<P>If you are installing MPI yourself, we recommend MPICH 1.2 or 2.0 or
OpenMPI.  MPICH can be downloaded from the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">Argonne MPI
site</A>.  OpenMPI can be downloaded the
<A HREF = "http://www.open-mpi.org">OpenMPI site</A>.  If you are running on a big
parallel platform, your system admins or the vendor should have
already installed a version of MPI, which will be faster than MPICH or
OpenMPI, so find out how to build and link with it.  If you use MPICH
or OpenMPI, you will have to configure and build it for your platform.
The MPI configure script should have compiler options to enable you to
use the same compiler you use for the SPARTA build, which can avoid
problems that can arise when linking SPARTA to the MPI library.
</P>
<P>If you just want to run SPARTA on a single processor, you can use the
dummy MPI library provided in src/STUBS, since you don't need a true
MPI library installed on your system.  You will also need to build the
STUBS library for your platform before making SPARTA itself.  From the
src directory, type "make stubs", or from within the STUBS dir, type
"make" and it should create a libmpi.a suitable for linking to SPARTA.
If this build fails, you will need to edit the STUBS/Makefile for your
platform.
</P>
<P>The file STUBS/mpi.cpp provides a CPU timer function called
MPI_Wtime() that calls gettimeofday() .  If your system doesn't
support gettimeofday() , you'll need to insert code to call another
timer.  Note that the ANSI-standard function clock() function rolls
over after an hour or so, and is therefore insufficient for timing
long SPARTA simulations.
</P>
<P><B>Step 6</B>
</P>
<P>The 3 JPG variables allow you to specify a JPEG and/or PNG library
which LAMMPS uses when writing out JPEG or PNG files via the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command. These can be left blank if you do not
use the -DLAMMPS_JPEG or -DLAMMPS_PNG switches discussed above in Step
4, since in that case JPEG/PNG output will be disabled.
</P>
<P>A standard JPEG library usually goes by the name libjpeg.a or
libjpeg.so and has an associated header file jpeglib.h. Whichever JPEG
library you have on your platform, you'll need to set the appropriate
JPG_INC, JPG_PATH, and JPG_LIB variables, so that the compiler and
linker can find it.
</P>
<P>A standard PNG library usually goes by the name libpng.a or libpng.so
and has an associated header file png.h. Whichever PNG library you
have on your platform, you'll need to set the appropriate JPG_INC,
JPG_PATH, and JPG_LIB variables, so that the compiler and linker can
find it.
</P>
<P>As before, if these header and library files are in the usual place on
your machine, you may not need to set these variables.
</P>
<P><B>Step 7</B>
</P>
<P>That's it.  Once you have a correct Makefile.foo, and you have
pre-built any other needed libraries (e.g. MPI), all you need to do
from the src directory is type one of the following:
</P>
<PRE>make foo
make -j N foo
gmake foo
gmake -j N foo 
</PRE>
<P>The -j or -j N switches perform a parallel build which can be much
faster, depending on how many cores your compilation machine has.  N
is the number of cores the build runs on.
</P>
<P>You should get the executable spa_foo when the build is complete.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_3"></A><B><I>Errors that can occur when making SPARTA:</I></B> 

<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If an error occurs when building SPARTA, the compiler
or linker will state very explicitly what the problem is.  The error
message should give you a hint as to which of the steps above has
failed, and what you need to do in order to fix it.  Building a code
with a Makefile is a very logical process.  The compiler and linker
need to find the appropriate files and those files need to be
compatible with SPARTA source files.  When a make fails, there is
usually a very simple reason, which you or a local expert will need to
fix.
</P>
<P>Here are two non-obvious errors that can occur:
</P>
<P>(1) If the make command breaks immediately with errors that indicate
it can't find files with a "*" in their names, this can be because
your machine's native make doesn't support wildcard expansion in a
makefile.  Try gmake instead of make.  If that doesn't work, try using
a -f switch with your make command to use a pre-generated
Makefile.list which explicitly lists all the needed files, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>make makelist
make -f Makefile.list g++
gmake -f Makefile.list mac 
</PRE>
<P>The first "make" command will create a current Makefile.list with all
the file names in your src dir.  The 2nd "make" command (make or
gmake) will use it to build SPARTA.
</P>
<P>(2) If you get an error that says something like 'identifier "atoll"
is undefined', then your machine does not support "long long"
integers.  Try using the -DSPARTA_LONGLONG_TO_LONG setting described
above in Step 4.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_4"></A><B><I>Additional build tips:</I></B> 

<P>(1) Building SPARTA for multiple platforms.
</P>
<P>You can make SPARTA for multiple platforms from the same src
directory.  Each target creates its own object sub-directory called
Obj_name where it stores the system-specific *.o files.
</P>
<P>(2) Cleaning up.
</P>
<P>Typing "make clean-all" or "make clean-foo" will delete *.o object
files created when SPARTA is built, for either all builds or for a
particular machine.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_5"></A><B><I>Building for a Mac:</I></B> 

<P>OS X is BSD Unix, so it should just work.  See the Makefile.mac file.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "start_2_6"></A><B><I>Building for Windows:</I></B> 

<P>At some point we may provide a pre-built Windows executable
for SPARTA.  Until then you will need to build an executable from 
source files.
</P>
<P>One way to do this is install and use cygwin to build SPARTA with a
standard Linux make, just as you would on any Linux box.
</P>
<P>You can also import the *.cpp and *.h files into Microsoft Visual
Studio.  If someone does this and wants to provide project files or
other Windows build tips, please send them to the
<A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</A> and we will include
them in the distribution.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_3"></A>2.3 Building SPARTA as a library 
</H4>
<P>SPARTA can be built as either a static or shared library, which can
then be called from another application or a scripting language.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_7">Section 4.7</A> for more info on coupling
SPARTA to other codes.  See <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Section 9</A> for more
info on wrapping and running SPARTA from Python.
</P>
<H5><B>Static library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>To build SPARTA as a static library (*.a file on Linux), type
</P>
<PRE>make makelib
make -f Makefile.lib foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the machine name.  This kind of library is typically used
to statically link SPARTA to a driver application, so that you can
insure all dependencies are satisfied at compile time.  The first
"make" command will create a current Makefile.lib with all the file
names in your src dir.  The second "make" command will use it to build
SPARTA as a static library, using the ARCHIVE and ARFLAGS settings in
src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.  The build will create the file libsparta_foo.a
which another application can link to.
</P>
<H5><B>Shared library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>To build SPARTA as a shared library (*.so file on Linux), which can be
dynamically loaded, e.g. from Python, type
</P>
<PRE>make makeshlib
make -f Makefile.shlib foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the machine name.  This kind of library is required when
wrapping SPARTA with Python; see <A HREF = "Section_python.html">Section_python</A>
for details.  The first "make" command will create a current
Makefile.shlib with all the file names in your src dir.  The second
"make" command will use it to build SPARTA as a shared library, using
the SHFLAGS and SHLIBFLAGS settings in src/MAKE/Makefile.foo.  The
build will create the file libsparta_foo.so which another application
can link to dyamically.  It will also create a soft link libsparta.so,
which the Python wrapper uses by default.
</P>
<P>Note that for a shared library to be usable by a calling program, all
the auxiliary libraries it depends on must also exist as shared
libraries.  This will be the case for libraries included with SPARTA,
such as the dummy MPI library in src/STUBS, since they are always
built as shared libraries with the -fPIC switch.  However, if a
library like MPI does not exist as a shared library, the second make
command will generate an error.  This means you will need to install a
shared library version of the package.  The build instructions for the
library should tell you how to do this.
</P>
<P>As an example, here is how to build and install the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPICH
library</A>, a popular open-source version of MPI, distributed by
Argonne National Labs, as a shared library in the default
/usr/local/lib location:
</P>


<PRE>./configure --enable-shared
make
make install 
</PRE>
<P>You may need to use "sudo make install" in place of the last line if
you do not have write privileges for /usr/local/lib.  The end result
should be the file /usr/local/lib/libmpich.so.
</P>
<H5><B>Additional requirement for using a shared library:</B> 
</H5>
<P>The operating system finds shared libraries to load at run-time using
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  So you may wish to copy the
file src/libsparta.so or src/libsparta_g++.so (for example) to a place
the system can find it by default, such as /usr/local/lib, or you may
wish to add the SPARTA src directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the
current version of the shared library is always available to programs
that use it.
</P>
<P>For the csh or tcsh shells, you would add something like this to your
~/.cshrc file:
</P>
<PRE>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $<I>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</I>:/home/sjplimp/sparta/src 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_4"></A>2.4 Running SPARTA 
</H4>
<P>By default, SPARTA runs by reading commands from standard input.  Thus
if you run the SPARTA executable by itself, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>spa_g++ 
</PRE>
<P>it will simply wait, expecting commands from the keyboard.  Typically
you should put commands in an input script and use I/O redirection,
e.g.
</P>
<PRE>spa_g++ < in.file 
</PRE>
<P>For parallel environments this should also work.  If it does not, use
the '-in' command-line switch, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>spa_g++ -in in.file 
</PRE>
<P><A HREF = "Section_commands.html">Section 3</A> describes how input scripts are
structured and what commands they contain.
</P>
<P>You can test SPARTA on any of the sample inputs provided in the
examples or bench directory.  Input scripts are named in.* and sample
outputs are named log.*.name.P where name is a machine and P is the
number of processors it was run on.
</P>
<P>Here is how you might run one of the benchmarks on a
Linux box, using mpirun to launch a parallel job:
</P>
<PRE>cd src
make g++
cp spa_g++ ../bench
cd ../bench
mpirun -np 4 spa_g++ < in.free 
</PRE>
<P>See <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/bench.html">this page</A> for timings for this and the other benchmarks on
various platforms.
</P>


<P>The screen output from SPARTA is described in the next section.  As it
runs, SPARTA also writes a log.sparta file with the same information.
</P>
<P>Note that this sequence of commands copies the SPARTA executable
(spa_g++) to the directory with the input files.  This may not be
necessary, but some versions of MPI reset the working directory to
where the executable is, rather than leave it as the directory where
you launch mpirun from (if you launch spa_g++ on its own and not under
mpirun).  If that happens, SPARTA will look for additional input files
and write its output files to the executable directory, rather than
your working directory, which is probably not what you want.
</P>
<P>If SPARTA encounters errors in the input script or while running a
simulation it will print an ERROR message and stop or a WARNING
message and continue.  See <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">Section 10</A> for a
discussion of the various kinds of errors SPARTA can or can't detect,
a list of all ERROR and WARNING messages, and what to do about them.
</P>
<P>SPARTA can run a problem on any number of processors, including a
single processor.  The random numbers used by each processor will be
different so you should only expect statistical consistency if the
same problem is run on different numbers of processors.
</P>
<P>SPARTA can run as large a problem as will fit in the physical memory
of one or more processors.  If you run out of memory, you must run on
more processors or setup a smaller problem.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "start_5"></A>2.5 Command-line options 
</H4>
<P>At run time, SPARTA recognizes several optional command-line switches
which may be used in any order.  Either the full word or a one-or-two
letter abbreviation can be used:
</P>
<UL><LI>-e or -echo
<LI>-i or -in
<LI>-h or -help
<LI>-l or -log
<LI>-p or -partition
<LI>-pl or -plog
<LI>-ps or -pscreen
<LI>-sc or -screen
<LI>-v or -var 
</UL>
<P>For example, spa_g++ might be launched as follows:
</P>
<PRE>mpirun -np 16 spa_g++ -v f tmp.out -l my.log -sc none < in.sphere
mpirun -np 16 spa_g++ -var f tmp.out -log my.log -screen none < in.sphere 
</PRE>
<P>Here are the details on the options:
</P>
<PRE>-echo style 
</PRE>
<P>Set the style of command echoing.  The style can be <I>none</I> or <I>screen</I>
or <I>log</I> or <I>both</I>.  Depending on the style, each command read from
the input script will be echoed to the screen and/or logfile.  This
can be useful to figure out which line of your script is causing an
input error.  The default value is <I>log</I>.  The echo style can also be
set by using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo</A> command in the input script itself.
</P>
<PRE>-in file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file to use as an input script.  This is an optional switch
when running SPARTA in one-partition mode.  If it is not specified,
SPARTA reads its input script from stdin - e.g. spa_g++ < in.run.
This is a required switch when running SPARTA in multi-partition mode,
since multiple processors cannot all read from stdin.
</P>
<PRE>-help 
</PRE>
<P>Print a list of options compiled into this executable for each SPARTA
style (fix, compute, collide, etc).  SPARTA will print the info and
immediately exit if this switch is used.
</P>
<PRE>-log file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a log file for SPARTA to write status information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, SPARTA writes to the
file log.sparta.  If this switch is used, SPARTA writes to the
specified file.  In multi-partition mode, if the switch is not used, a
log.sparta file is created with hi-level status information.  Each
partition also writes to a log.sparta.N file where N is the partition
ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode, the hi-level
logfile is named "file" and each partition also logs information to a
file.N.  For both one-partition and multi-partition mode, if the
specified file is "none", then no log files are created.  Using a
<A HREF = "log.html">log</A> command in the input script will override this setting.
Option -plog will override the name of the partition log files file.N.
</P>
<PRE>-partition 8x2 4 5 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Invoke SPARTA in multi-partition mode.  When SPARTA is run on P
processors and this switch is not used, SPARTA runs in one partition,
i.e. all P processors run a single simulation.  If this switch is
used, the P processors are split into separate partitions and each
partition runs its own simulation.  The arguments to the switch
specify the number of processors in each partition.  Arguments of the
form MxN mean M partitions, each with N processors.  Arguments of the
form N mean a single partition with N processors.  The sum of
processors in all partitions must equal P.  Thus the command
"-partition 8x2 4 5" has 10 partitions and runs on a total of 25
processors.  Note that with MPI installed on a machine (e.g. your
desktop), you can run on more (virtual) processors than you have
physical processors.
</P>
<P>To run multiple independent simulatoins from one input script, using
multiple partitions, see <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_3">Section 4.3</A> of
the manual.  World- and universe-style variables are useful in this
context.
</P>
<PRE>-plog file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify the base name for the partition log files, so partition N
writes log information to file.N. If file is none, then no partition
log files are created.  This overrides the filename specified in the
-log command-line option.  This option is useful when working with
large numbers of partitions, allowing the partition log files to be
suppressed (-plog none) or placed in a sub-directory (-plog
replica_files/log.sparta) If this option is not used the log file for
partition N is log.sparta.N or whatever is specified by the -log
command-line option.
</P>
<PRE>-pscreen file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify the base name for the partition screen file, so partition N
writes screen information to file.N. If file is none, then no
partition screen files are created.  This overrides the filename
specified in the -screen command-line option.  This option is useful
when working with large numbers of partitions, allowing the partition
screen files to be suppressed (-pscreen none) or placed in a
sub-directory (-pscreen replica_files/screen) If this option is not
used the screen file for partition N is screen.N or whatever is
specified by the -screen command-line option.
</P>
<PRE>-screen file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file for SPARTA to write its screen information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, SPARTA writes to the
screen.  If this switch is used, SPARTA writes to the specified file
instead and you will see no screen output.  In multi-partition mode,
if the switch is not used, hi-level status information is written to
the screen.  Each partition also writes to a screen.N file where N is
the partition ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode,
the hi-level screen dump is named "file" and each partition also
writes screen information to a file.N.  For both one-partition and
multi-partition mode, if the specified file is "none", then no screen
output is performed. Option -pscreen will override the name of the 
partition screen files file.N.
</P>
<PRE>-var name value1 value2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a variable that will be defined for substitution purposes when
the input script is read.  "Name" is the variable name which can be a
single character (referenced as $x in the input script) or a full
string (referenced as ${abc}).  An <A HREF = "variable.html">index-style
variable</A> will be created and populated with the
subsequent values, e.g. a set of filenames.  Using this command-line
option is equivalent to putting the line "variable name index value1
value2 ..."  at the beginning of the input script.  Defining an index
variable as a command-line argument overrides any setting for the same
index variable in the input script, since index variables cannot be
re-defined.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for more info on
defining index and other kinds of variables and <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#cmd_2">Section
3.2</A> for more info on using variables in
input scripts.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently, the command-line parser looks for arguments
that start with "-" to indicate new switches. Thus you cannot specify
multiple variable values if any of they start with a "-", e.g. a
negative numeric value. It is OK if the first value1 starts with a
"-", since it is automatically skipped.

<H4><A NAME = "start_6"></A>2.6 SPARTA screen output 
</H4>
<P>As SPARTA reads an input script, it prints information to both the
screen and a log file about significant actions it takes to setup a
simulation.  When the simulation is ready to begin, SPARTA performs
various initializations and prints the amount of memory (in MBytes per
processor) that the simulation requires.  It also prints details of
the initial state of the system.  During the run itself, statistical
information is printed periodically, every few timesteps.  When the
run concludes, SPARTA prints the final state and a total run time for
the simulation.  It then appends statistics about the CPU time and
size of information stored for the simulation.  An example set of
statistics is shown here:

<P>The first line gives the total CPU run time for the simulation, in
seconds.
</P>
<P>The next section gives some statistics about the run.  These are total
counts of particle moves, grid cells touched by particles, the number
of particles communicated between processors, collisions of particles
with the global boundary and with surface elements (none in this
problem), as well as collision and reaction statistics.
</P>
<P>The next section gives additional statistics, normalized by timestep
or processor count.
</P>
<P>The next to last section gives a breakdown of the CPU timing (in
seconds) in 6 categories.  The first four are timings for particles
moves, which includes interaction with surface elements, then particle
collisions, then sorting of particles (required to perform
collisions), and communication of particles between processors.  The
percentage of CPU time for each category is shown in parenthesis.
</P>
<P>The last section is a histogramming across processors of various
per-processor statistics: particle count, owned grid cells, processor,
ghost grid cells which are copies of cells owned by other processors,
and empty cells which are ghost cells without surface information
(only used to pass particles to neighboring processors).
</P>
<P>The ave value is the average across all processors.  The max and min
values are for any processor.  The 10-bin histogram shows the
distribution of the value across processors.  The total number of
histogram counts is equal to the number of processors.
