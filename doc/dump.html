<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of simulation quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps in one of several styles.  The <I>image</I> style is the
exception; it creates a JPG or PPM image file of the simulation
configuration every N timesteps, as discussed on the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump
image</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>The ID for a dump is used to identify the dump in other commands.
Each dump ID must be unique.  The ID can only contain alphanumeric
characters and underscores.  You can specify multiple dumpes of the
same style so long as they have different IDs.  A dump can be deleted
with the <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A> command, after which its ID can be
re-used.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting determines what quantities are written to the file
and in what format.  The <I>particle</I>, <I>grid</I>, <I>surf</I> options are for
particles, grid cells, or surface elements.  Settings made via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command can also alter what info is
included in the file and the format of individual values.
</P>
<P>The <I>select-ID</I> setting determines which particles, grid cells, or
surface elements are output.  For <I>style</I> = <I>particle</I>, the
<I>select-ID</I> is a mixture ID as defined by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A>
command.  Only particles whose species are part of the mixture are
output.  For <I>style</I> = <I>grid</I>, the <I>select-ID</I> is for a grid group, as
defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A> command.  Only grid cells in
the group are output.  For <I>style</I> = <I>surf</I>, the <I>select-ID</I> is for a
surface eleemnt group, as defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group surf</A>
command.  Only surface elements in the group are output.
</P>
<P>As described below, the filename determines the kind of output (text
or binary or gzipped, one big file or one per timestep, one big file
or one per processor).
</P>
<P>The precision of values output to text-based dump files can be
controlled by the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify format</A> command and
its options.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>particle</I> and <I>grid</I> and <I>surf</I> styles create files in a simple
text format that is self-explanatory when viewing a dump file.  Many
of the SPARTA <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">post-processing tools</A>, including
<A HREF = "http://pizza.sandia.gov">Pizza.py</A>, work with this format.
</P>
<P>For post-processing purposes the text files are self-describing in the
following sense.
</P>
<P>The dimensions of the simulation box are included in each snapshot.
This information is formatted as:
</P>
<PRE>ITEM: BOX BOUNDS xx yy zz
xlo xhi
ylo yhi
zlo zhi 
</PRE>
<P>where xlo,xhi are the maximum extents of the simulation box in the
x-dimension, and similarly for y and z.  The "xx yy zz" represent 6
characters that encode the style of boundary for each of the 6
simulation box boundaries (xlo,xhi and ylo,yhi and zlo,zhi).  Each of
the 6 characters is either o = outflow, p = periodic, or s = specular.
See the <A HREF = "doc/boundary.html">boundary</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>The "ITEM: NUMBER OF ATOMS" or "ITEM: NUMBER OF CELLS" or "ITEM:
NUMBER OF SURFS" entry in each snapshot gives the number of particles,
grid cells, surfaces to follow.
</P>
<P>The "ITEM: ATOMS" or "ITEM: CELLS" or "ITEM: SURFS" entry in each
snapshot lists column descriptors for the per-particle or per-grid or
per-surf lines that follow.  The descriptors are the attributes
specied in the dump command for the style.  Possible attributes are
listed above and will appear in the order specified.  An explanation
of the possible attributes is given below.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0).  Note that this means a dump will not be performed on the
initial timestep after the dump command is invoked, if the current
timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be changed via the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command.  N can be changed
between runs by using the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A>
command.
</P>
<P>The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A>
command is used or when SPARTA exits.
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,
tmp.dump.20000, etc.  Note that the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify pad</A>
command can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length
(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files
in order by some post-processing tools.
</P>
<P>If a "%" character appears in the filename, then one file is written
for each processor and the "%" character is replaced with the
processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes
tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller
files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that
support parallel I/O for output.
</P>
<P>Note that the "*" and "%" characters can be used together to produce a
large number of small dump files!
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".bin", the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.  Of course, when post-processing, you will need
to convert it back to text format (see the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html#binary">binary2txt
tool</A>) or write your own code to read the
binary file.  The format of the binary file can be understood by
looking at the tools/binary2txt.cpp file.
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with ".gz", the dump file (or files, if "*" or "%"
is also used) is written in gzipped format.  A gzipped dump file will
be about 3x smaller than the text version, but will also take longer
to write.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Note that in the discussion which follows, for styles which can
reference values from a compute or fix, like the <I>particle</I>, <I>grid</I>,
or <I>surf</I> styles, the bracketed index I can be specified using a
wildcard asterisk with the index to effectively specify multiple
values.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the
size of the vector (for <I>mode</I> = scalar) or the number of columns in
the array (for <I>mode</I> = vector), then an asterisk with no numeric
values means all indices from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all
indices from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all
indices from n to N (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all indices
from m to n (inclusive).
</P>
<P>Using a wildcard is the same as if the individual columns of the array
had been listed one by one.  E.g. these 2 dump commands are
equivalent, since the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A> command creates
a per-grid array with 3 columns:
</P>
<PRE>compute myGrid all all u v w
dump 2 grid all 100 tmp.dump id c_myGrid[*]
dump 2 grid all 100 tmp.dump id c_myGrid[1] c_myGrid[2] c_myGrid[3] 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>This section explains the particle attributes that can be specified as
part of the <I>particle</I> style.
</P>
<P><I>Id</I> is the particle ID.  <I>Type</I> is an integer index representing the
particle species.  It is a value from 1 to Nspecies, The value
corresponds to the order in which species were defined via the
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.  <I>Proc</I> is the ID of the processor
which currently owns the particle.
</P>
<P>The <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I> attributes write particle coordinates "unscaled", in
the appropriate distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  Use <I>xs</I>, <I>ys</I>, <I>zs</I> to
"scale" the coordinates to the box size, so that each value is 0.0 to
1.0.
</P>
<P><I>Vx</I>, <I>vy</I>, <I>vz</I> are components of particle velocity.  The <I>ke</I>,
<I>erot</I>, and <I>evib</I> attributes are the kinetic, rotational, and
vibrational energies of the particle.  A particle's kinetic energy is
given by 1/2 m (vx^2 + vy^2 + vz^2).  The way that rotational and
vibrational energy is treated in collisions and stored by particles is
affected by the <A HREF = "collid_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>p_ID</I> and <I>p_ID[N]</I> attributes allow custom per-particle
vectors or arrays defined by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command to be output.
The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the
custom particle attribute that the fix defines.  See individal
commands for details, e.g. the <A HREF = "fix_ambipolar.html">fix ambipolar</A>
command which defines the custom vector "ionambi" and the custom array
"velambi".
</P>
<P>If <I>p_ID</I> is used as a attribute, the custom attribute must be a
vector, and it is output.  If <I>p_ID[N]</I> is used, the custom
attribute must be an array, and N must be in the range from 1-M, which
will output the Nth column of the M-column array.
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-particle vectors or
arrays calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output.  The ID in
the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that
has been defined previously in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, the compute must calculate a
per-particle vector, and it is output.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, the
compute must calculate a per-particle array, and N must be in the
range from 1-M, which will output the Nth column of the M-column
array.  See the discussion above for how N can be specified with a
wildcard asterisk to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow vector or array
per-particle quantities calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.
The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix
that has been defined previously in the input script.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, the fix must calculate a
per-particle vector, and it is output.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, the
fix must calculate a per-particle array, and N must be in the range
from 1-M, which will output the Nth column of the M-column array.
See the discussion above for how N can be specified with a
wildcard asterisk to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-particle vectors calculated by a
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only a particle-style
variable can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates
per-particle values.  Variables of style <I>particle</I> can reference
per-particle attributes, stats keywords, or invoke other computes,
fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so this is a very general
means of creating quantities to output to a dump file.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">Section 10</A> of the manual for information on
how to add new compute and fix styles to SPARTA to calculate
per-particle quantities which could then be output into dump files.
</P>
<HR>

<P>This section explains the grid cell attributes that can be specified
as part of the <I>grid</I> style.
</P>
<P>Note that dump grid will output one line (per snapshot) for 3 kinds of
child cells: unsplit cells, cut cells, and sub cells of split cells.
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 6.8</A> of the manual gives details
of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.  This
is different than <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands
that produce per grid information, which also include split cells in
their output.  The dump grid command discards that output since the
sub cells of a split cell provide the needed information for further
processing and visualization.  Note that unsplit cells can
be outside (in the flow) or inside surface objects, if they exist.
</P>
<P><I>Id</I> and <I>idstr</I> are two different forms of the grid cell ID.  In
SPARTA each grid cell is assigned a unique ID which represents its
location, in a topological sense, within the hierarchical grid.  This
ID is stored as an integer such as 5774983, but can also be decoded
into a string such as 33-4-6, which makes it easier to understand the
grid hierarchy.  In this case it means the grid cell is at the 3rd
level of the hierarchy.  Its grandparent cell was 33 at the 1st level,
its parent was cell 4 (at level 2) within cell 33, and the cell itself
is cell 6 (at level 3) within cell 4 within cell 33.  If you specify
<I>id</I>, the ID is printed directly as an integer.  If you specify
<I>idstr</I>, it is printed as a string.
</P>
<P><I>Proc</I> is the ID of the processor which currently owns the grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>xlo</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>zlo</I> attributes write the coordinates of the
lower-left corner of the grid cell in the appropriate distance
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The <I>xhi</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zhi</I> attributes write the
coordinates of the upper-right corner of the grid cell.  The <I>xc</I>,
<I>yc</I>, <I>zc</I> attributes write the coordinates of the center point of the
grid cell.  The <I>zlo</I>, <I>zhi</I>, <I>zc</I> attributes cannot be used for a 2d
simulation.
</P>
<P>The <I>vol</I> attribute is the flow volume of the grid cell (or area in
2d) for unsplit or cut or sub cells.  <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section
4.8</A> of the manual gives details of how
SPARTA defines unsplit and sub cells.  Flow volume is the portion of
the grid cell that is accessible to particles, i.e. outside any closed
surface that may intersect the cell.  Note that unsplit cells which
are inside a surface object will have a flow volume of 0.0.  Likewise
a cut cell which is inside a suface object but which is intersected by
surface element(s) which only touch a face, edge, or corner point of
the grid cell, will have a flow volume of 0.0.
</P>
<P>The <I>g_ID</I> and <I>g_ID[N]</I> attributes allow custom per-grid vectors or
arrays defined by the <A HREF = "read_grid.html">read_grid</A> or <A HREF = "surf_react_implicit.html">surf_react
implicit</A> command to be output.  (The
surf/react implicit command has not yet been released in public
SPPARKS).  The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID
of the custom per-grid attribute that the command defines.  See
individal commands for details.
</P>
<P>If <I>g_ID</I> is used as a attribute, the custom attribute must be a
vector, and it is output.  If <I>g_ID[N]</I> is used, the custom
attribute must be an array, and N must be in the range from 1-M, which
will output the Nth column of the M-column array.
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-grid vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, and the compute calculates a
per-grid vector, then the per-grid vector is output.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I>
is used, then N must be in the range from 1-M, which will output the
Nth column of the M-column per-grid array calculated by the compute.
See the discussion above for how N can be specified with a wildcard
asterisk to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-grid vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.  The ID in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been defined
previously in the input script.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, and the fix calculates a per-grid
vector, then the per-grid vector is output.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used,
then N must be in the range from 1-M, which will output the Nth column
of the M-columne per-grid array calculated by the fix.  See the
discussion above for how N can be specified with a wildcard asterisk
to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-grid vectors calculated by a
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been

<HR>

<P>This section explains the surface element attributes that can be
specified as part of the <I>surf</I> style.  For 2d simulations, a surface
element is a line segment with 2 end points.  Crossing the unit +z
vector into the vector (v2-v1) determines the outward normal of the
line segment.  For 3d simulations, a surface element is a triangle
with 3 corner points.  Crossing (v2-v1) into (v3-v1) determines the
outward normal of the triangle.
</P>
<P><I>Id</I> is the surface element ID.
</P>
<P>The <I>v1x</I>, <I>v1y</I>, <I>v1z</I>, <I>v2x</I>, <I>v2y</I>, <I>v2z</I>, <I>v3x</I>, <I>v3y</I>, <I>v3z</I>
attributes write the coordinates of the vertices of the end or corner
points of the surface element.  The <I>v1z</I>, <I>v2z</I>, <I>v3x</I>, <I>v3y</I>, and
<I>v3z</I> attributes cannot be used for a 2d simulation.
</P>
<P>The <I>s_ID</I> and <I>s_ID[N]</I> attributes allow output of custom per-surf
attributes which store either single or multiple values per surface
element.  They can be defined and initialized in data files, e.g. via
the read_surf command.  Or they can be defined and used by specific
commands, e.g. <A HREF = "fix_surf_temp.html">fix surf/temp</A> or <A HREF = "surf_react_adsorb.html">surf_react
adsorb</A>.  The IDs (names) of each attribute are
set by the user or defined by the command.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_17">Section
6.17</A> for more discussion of custom
attributes.
</P>
<P>If <I>s_ID</I> is used as a attribute, the custom attribute must be a
vector.  If <I>s_ID[N]</I> is used, the custom attribute must be an
array, and N must be in the range from 1-M for an M-column array.
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-surf vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> to be output.  The ID in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the compute that has
been defined previously in the input script.  See the
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, and the compute calculates a per-srf
vector, then the per-surf vector is output.  If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used,
then N must be in the range from 1-M, which will output the Nth column
of the M-column per-surf array calculated by the compute.  See the
discussion above for how N can be specified with a wildcard asterisk
to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-surf vectors or arrays
calculated by a <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to be output.  The ID in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual ID of the fix that has been defined
previously in the input script.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, and the fix calculates a per-surf
vector, then the per-surf vector is output.  If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used,
then N must be in the range from 1-M, which will output the Nth column
of the M-column per-surf array calculated by the fix.  See the
discussion above for how N can be specified with a wildcard asterisk
to effectively specify multiple values.
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-surf vectors calculated by a
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> to be output.  The name in the attribute
should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that has been
defined previously in the input script.  Only a surf-style variable
can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates per-surf
values.  Variables of style <I>surf</I> can reference per-surf attributes,
stats keywords, or invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when
they are evaluated, so this is a very general means of creating
quantities to output to a dump file.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Surf-style variables have not yet been implemented in
SPARTA.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">Section 10</A> of the manual for information on
how to add new compute and fix styles to SPARTA to calculate per-surf
quantities which could then be output into dump files.
