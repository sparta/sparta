compute boundary command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID boundary mix-ID value1 value2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
boundary = style name of this compute command :l
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :l
one or more values can be appended :l
value = {n} or {press} or {shx} or {shy} or {shz} or {ke} :l
  n = count of molecules hitting boundary
  press = magnitude of normal pressure on boundary
  shx,shy,shz = components of shear stress on boundary
  ke = flux of kinetic energy on boundary :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 boundary all n press eng
compute mine boundary species press shx shy shz :pre

These commands will dump averages for all species and each boundary to
a file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 boundary species n press shx shy shz
fix 1 ave/time 10 100 1000 c_1 file tmp.boundary :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each
boundary (i.e. face) of the simulation box, based on the molecules
that strike that boundary.  The values are summed for each group of
species in the specified mixture.  See the "mixture"_mixture.html
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.

The manner in which statistics are tallied for each boundary depends
on the style of boundary as specified by the "boundary"_boundary.html
command.  For {outflow} boundaries, only the flux of particles leaving
the simulation box contributes to the pressure, stress, and energy;
there is no contribution from reflected particles.  For {periodic}
boundaries, only the count {n} is tallied, since the particles exert
no pressure or stress on the boundary.  For {specular} boundaries,
there is a before and after pressure and stress contribution from each
particle that collides with the boundary, but no energy contribution,
since the collisions conserve energy.  For {surface} boundaries, each
collision may contribute to all the values, depending on the "surface
collision model"_surf_collide.html.

The {n} value counts the number of molecules in the group striking the
boundary or passing through it.

The {press} value calculates the pressure {P} exerted on the boundary
in the normal direction by molecules in the group, such that outward
pressure is positive.  This is computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
P = Sum_i (p_delta_i dot N) / (A * dt) :pre

where p_delta is the change in momentum of a particle, whose velocity
changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the boundary.  The
pressure exerted on the boundary is the sum over all contributing
p_delta dotted into the normal N of the boundary which is directed
into the box, normalized by A = the area of the boundary face and dt =
the timestep.

The {shx}, {shy}, {shz} values calculate the shear pressure components
Sx, Sy, Sz extered on the boundary in the tangential direction to its
normal by molecules in the group, with respect to the x, y, z
coordinate axes.  These are computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
p_delta_t = p_delta - (p_delta dot N) N
Sx = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_x) / (A * dt)
Sy = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_y) / (A * dt)
Sz = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_z) / (A * dt) :pre

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, and dt are defined as before.
P_delta_t is the tangential component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle.  P_delta_t_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z
components.

The {ke} value calculates the kinetic energy flux {Eflux} imparted to
the boundary by molecules in the group, such that energy lost by a
particle is a positive flux.  This is computed as

e_delta = 1/2 mass (V_post^2 - V_pre^2)
Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt) :pre

where e_delta is the kinetic energy change in a particle, whose
velocity changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the
boundary.  The energy flux imparted to the boundary is the sum over
all contributing e_delta, normalized by A = the area of the boundary
face and dt = the timestep.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
{n} and {u} values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be {n} and {u} for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be {n} and {u} for the second group, etc.  The number of
rows is 4 for a 2d simulation (xlo face, xhi, ylo, yhi) or 6 for a 3d
simulation (xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo, zhi).

The array can be accessed by any command that uses global array values
from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The array values will be in the "units"_units.html appropriate to the
individual values as described above.  {Press}, {shx}, {shy}, {shz}
are in in presure units.  {Ke} is in energy units.
