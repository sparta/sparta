<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Read the geometry of a surface from a file.  In SPARTA, a "surface" is
a collection of surface elements that represent the surface of one or
more physical objects which will be embedded in the global simulation
box.  The surface elements are triangles in 3d or line segments in 2d.
The surface elements for each physical object are required to be a
complete, connected set that tile the entire surface of the object.
See the discussion of watertight surfaces below.
</P>
<P>Particles collide with surface elements as they advect, and optionally
perform surface chemistry during the collision.  Collision statistics
for each surface element can be tallied via the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute
surf</A> command, time-averaged via the <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix
ave/surf</A> command, and ouput via the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
surface</A> command.
</P>
<P>All of the surface elements in the file are assigned a surfcoll-ID,
which is the ID of a surface collision model previously defined by the
<A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A> command.  This model will be used to
perform collisions when particles collide with elements in
the surface.
</P>
<P>The format of the surface file is discussed below.  The optional
keywords allow the vertices in the file to be translated, scaled, and
rotated in various ways.  These allow a single surface file,
e.g. containing a unit sphere, to be used in a variety of simulations.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The specified file can be a text file or a gzipped text file (detected
by a .gz suffix).
</P>
<P>A surface file has a header and a body.  The header appears first.
The first line of the header is always skipped; it typically contains
a description of the file.  Then lines are read one at a time.  Lines
can have a trailing comment starting with '#' that is ignored.  If the
line is blank (only whitespace after comment is deleted), it is
skipped.  If the line contains a header keyword, the corresponding
value is read from the line.  If it doesn't contain a header keyword,
the line begins the body of the file.
</P>
<P>The body of the file contains one or more sections.  The first line of
a section has only a keyword.  The next line is skipped.  The
remaining lines of the section contain values.  The number of lines in
a section depends on the section keyword as described below.  Zero or
more blank lines can be used between sections.  Sections can appear in
any order.
</P>
<P>The formatting of individual lines in the surface file (indentation,
spacing between words and numbers) is not important except that header
and section keywords must be capitalized as shown and can't have extra
white space between their words.
</P>
<P>These are the recognized header keywords.  Header lines can come in
any order.  The value(s) are read from the beginning of the line.
Thus the keyword <I>points</I> should be in a line like "1000 points".
</P>
<UL><LI><I>points</I> = # of points in surface
<LI><I>lines</I> = # of line segments in surface (only allowed for 2d)
<LI><I>triangles</I> = # of triangles in surface (only allowed for 3d) 
</UL>
<P>These are the recognized section keywords for the body of the file.
</P>
<UL><LI><I>Points, Lines, Triangles</I> 
</UL>
<P>The <I>Points</I> section consists of N consecutive entries, where N = # of
points, each of this form:
</P>
<PRE>point-ID x y z    (for 3d) 
point-ID x y      (for 2d) 
</PRE>
<P>The point-ID is ignored; it is only added to assist in examining the
file.  The point-IDs should run consecutively from 1 to N.  <I>X,y,z</I>
are the coordinates of the point in distance units.  Note that for 2d
simulations, <I>z</I> should be omitted.
</P>
<P>The <I>Lines</I> section is only allowed for 2d simulations and consists of
N entries, where N = # of lines, each of this form:
</P>
<PRE>line-ID p1 p2 
</PRE>
<P>The line-ID is ignored; it is only added to assist in examining the
file.  <I>P1</I> and <I>p2</I> are the point-IDs of the 2 end points of the line
segment.  Each is a value from 1 to Npoints, as described above.
</P>
<P>The ordering of <I>p1</I> and <I>p2</I> is important as it defines the direction
of the outward normal for the line segment when a particle collides
with it.  Molecules only collide with the "outer" edge of a line
segment.  This is defined by a right-hand rule.  The outward normal N
= (0,0,1) x (p2-p1).  In other words, a unit z-direction vector is
crossed into the vector from <I>p1</I> to <I>p2</I> to determine the normal.
</P>
<P>The <I>Triangles</I> section is only allowed for 3d simulations and
consists of N entries, where N = # of triangles, each of this form:
</P>
<PRE>tri-ID p1 p2 p3 
</PRE>
<P>The tri-ID is ignored; it is only added to assist in examining the
file.  <I>P1</I> and <I>p2</I> and <I>p3</I> are the point-IDs of the 3 corner points
of the triangle.  Each is a value from 1 to Npoints, as described
above.
</P>
<P>The ordering of <I>p1</I> and <I>p2</I> and <I>p3</I> is important as it defines the
direction of the outward normal for the triangle when a particle
collides with it.  Molecules only collide with the "outer" face of a
triangle. This is defined by a right-hand rule.  The outward normal N
= (p2-p1) x (p3-p1).  In other words, the edge from <I>p1</I> to <I>p2</I> is
crossed into the edge from <I>p1</I> to <I>p3</I> to determine the normal.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The following optional keywords can be specified.  The geometric
transformations they describe are performed in the order they are
listed, which gives flexibility in how surfaces can be manipulated.
Note that the order may be important; e.g. performing an <I>origin</I>
operation followed by a <I>rotate</I> operation may not be the same as a
<I>rotate</I> followed by a <I>origin</I>.
</P>
<P>Most of the keywords perform a geometric transformation on all the
vertices in the surface file with respect to an origin point.  By
default the origin is (0.0,0.0,0.0), regardless of the position of
individual vertices in the file.
</P>
<P>The <I>origin</I> keyword resets the origin to the specified <I>Ox,Oy,Oz</I>.
This operation has no effect on the vertices.
</P>
<P>The <I>trans</I> keyword shifts or displaces the origin by the vector
(Dx,Dy,Dz).  It also displaces each vertex by (Dx,Dy,Dz).
</P>
<P>The <I>atrans</I> keyword resets the origin to an absolute point (Ax,Ay,Az)
which implies a displacement (Dx,Dy,Dz) from the current origin.  It
also displaces each vertex by (Dx,Dy,Dz).
</P>
<P>The <I>ftrans</I> keyword resets the origin to a fractional point
(Fx,Fy,Fz).  Fractional means that Fx = 0.0 is the lower edge/face in
the x-dimension and Fx = 1.0 is the upper edge/face in the
x-dimension, and similarly for Fy and Fz.  This change of origin
implies a displacement (Dx,Dy,Dz) from the current origin.  This
operation also displaces each vertex by (Dx,Dy,Dz).
</P>
<P>The <I>scale</I> keyword does not change the origin.  It computes the
displacement vector of each vertex from the origin (delx,dely,delz)
and scales that vector by (Sx,Sy,Sz), so that the new vertex
coordinate is (Ox + Sx*delx,Oy + Sy*dely,Oz + Sz*delz).
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate</I> keyword does not change the origin.  It rotates the
coordinates of all vertices by an angle <I>theta</I> in a counter-clockwise
direction, around the vector starting at the origin and pointing in
the direction <I>Rx,Ry,Rz</I>.  Any rotation can be represented by an
appropriate choice of origin, <I>theta</I> and (Rx,Ry,Rz).
</P>
<P>The <I>invert</I> keyword does not change the origin or any vertex
coordinates.  It flips the direction of the outward surface normal of
each surface element by changing the ordering of its vertices.  Since
particles only collide with the outer surface of a surface element,
this is a mechanism for using a surface files containing a single
sphere (for example) as either a sphere to embed in a flow field, or a
spherical outer boundary containing the flow.
</P>
<P>The <I>clip</I> keyword does not change the origin.  It truncates or
"clips" a surface that extends outside the simulation box in the
following manner.  In 3d, each of the 6 clip planes represented by
faces of the global simulation box are considered in turn.  Any
triangle that straddles the face (with points on both sides of the
clip plane), is truncated at the plane.  New points along the edges
that cross the plane are created.  A triangle may also become a
trapezoid, in which case it turned into 2 triangles.  Then all the
points on the side of the clip plane that is outside the box, are
projected onto the clip plane.  Finally, all triangles that lie in the
clip plane are removed, as are any points that are unused after the
triangle removal.  After this operation is repeated for all 6 faces,
the remaining surface is entirely inside the simulation box, though
some of its triangles may include points on the faces of the
simulation box.  A similar operation is performed in 2d with the 4
clip edges represented by the edges of the global simulation box.
</P>
<P>If you use the <I>clip</I> keyword, you should check the resulting
statistics of the clipped surface printed out by this command,
including the minimum size of line and triangle edge lengths.  It is
possible that very short lines or very small triangles will result
near the box surface due to the clipping opertion, depending on the
coordinates of the initial unclipped points.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command, and after a grid has been
created by the <A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>To read gzipped surface files, you must compile SPARTA with the
-DSPARTA_GZIP option - see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_2">this section</A>
section of the manual for details.
</P>
<P>Every vertex in the final surface (after translation, rotation,
scaling, etc) must be inside or on the surface of the global
simulation box.  Note that using the <I>clip</I> operation guarantees that
this will be the case.
</P>
<P>The surface elements in a single surface file must represent a
"watertight" surface.  For a 2d simulation this means that every point
is part of exactly 2 line segments.  For a 3d simulation it means that
every triangle edge is part of exactly 2 triangles.  Exceptions to
these rules are made for triangle edges (in 3d) that lie entirely in a
global face of the simulation box, of for line points (in 2d) that are
on a global edge of the simulation box.  This can be the case after
clipping.  This allows use of an object that only partially overlaps
with the simulation box, e.g. half of a sphere.
</P>
<P>Note that this definition of watertight does not require that the
surface elements in a file represent a single physical object;
multiple objects can be represented, provided each is watertight.
</P>
<P>Another restriction on surfaces is that they do not represent an
object that is "infinitely thin", so that two sides of the same object
lie in the same plane (3d) or on the same line (2d).  This will not
generate an error when the surface file is read, assuming the
watertight rule is followed.  However when particles collide with the
surface, errors will be generated if a particle hits the "inside" of a
surface element before hitting the "outside" of another element.  This
can occur for infinitely thin surfaces due to numeric round-off.
</P>
<P>Similarly, when running a simulation with multiple objects, read from
one or more surface files, you should insure they do not
overlap/intersect each other.  SPARTA does not check for this, but it
will typically lead to unphysical particle dynamics.
