[Description:]

Define a gas mixture and its properties.  A mixture can be referenced
by its ID in several other SPARTA commands such as
"create_particles"_create_particles.html or "per-grid
computes"_compute.html.  Any number of mixtures can be defined and
used in a simulation.

A mixture is a collection of one or more particle species as defined
by the "species"_species.html command.  Each species belongs to a
named group within the mixture so that particles of all species in the
group can be acted on together by other commands.  The mixture has
both global attributes and per-species attributes.  All attributes
have default values unless they are explicitly specified.

The ID for a mixture is used to identify the mixture in other
commands.  Each mixture ID must be unique.  The ID can only contain
alphanumeric characters and underscores.

Note that the mixture command can be used multiple times with the same
ID, to add species to the mixture, define groups within the mixture,
or change its attributes.  Also note that a species can belong to more
than one mixture.

There are 2 default mixtures defined by SPARTA that always exist.

The first default mixture has an ID = "all", and contains all species
that have been defined.  When new species are created via the
"species" command, they are automatically added to this mixture.  This
mixture has only a single group, also named "all", which all species
belong to.

The second default mixture has an ID = "species", and also contains
all species that have been defined.  When new species are created via
the "species" command, they are also automatically added to this
mixture.  This mixture defines one group per species, each with the
species name, so that each species in the mixture belongs to its own
group.

:line

Zero or more species can be specified in the mixture command.  If a
listed species is not already in the mixture, due to a previous
mixture command with the same ID, then that species is added to the
mixture.  As discussed below, it will be assigned to a default group
and assigned default per-species attributes, unless the appropriate
keywords are also specified.

Species can be specified which are already part of the mixture, to
change their group assignment or their per-species proerties, as
disussed below.

Zero species can be specified, if other keywords are used which alter
group assignments or change global attributes of the mixture, as
discussed below.

:line

These keywords set global attributes of the mixture.

The {nrho} keyword sets a global attribute of the mixture, namely its
density.  For 3d simulations the units of the specified {density} are
#/volume.  For 2d, the units are effectively #/area, since the
z-dimension thickness of the simulation box = 1.0.

The {vstream} keyword sets a global attribute of the mixture, namely
the streaming velocity.  Particles created using the mixture will use
the specified {Vx,Vy,Vz} values.

The {temp} keyword sets a global attribute of the mixture, namely the
thermal temperature of its particles.  When particles are created,
this value is used to sample a Gaussian velocity distribution, which
is superposed on the streaming velocity, when each particle's velocity
is initialized.

The {trot} keyword sets a global attribute of the mixture, namely the
rotational temperature of its particles.  When particles are created,
this value is used to sample a Gaussian energy distribution to define
each particle's rotational energy.  If this keyword is not specified,
the thermal temperature is used as the default.

The {tvig} keyword sets a global attribute of the mixture, namely the
vibrational temperature of its particles.  When particles are created,
this value is used to sample a Gaussian energy distribution to define
each particle's vibrational energy.  If this keyword is not specified,
the thermal temperature is used as the default.

:line

This keyword sets per-species attributes of the mixture.

The {frac} keyword sets a per-species attribute for individual species
in the mixture.  Each species has a relative fractional density, such
as 0.2, meaning one out of 5 particles is that species.  The sum of
this value across all species in the mixture must equal 1.0.  The
{frac} keyword sets this value for the listed species.  If this value
has never been set for M species out of the total N species in the
mixture, then when a simulation is run, the {frac} value for each of
the M species is set to (1 - sum)/M, where sum is the sum of the
{frac} values for the N-M assigned species.

:line

Each species in a mixture is assigned to exactly one group.  The
{group} keyword can be used to set or change these assignments.  Every
mixture has one or more named groups.

As described by the "collide"_collide.html command, mixture groups are
used when performing collisions so that collisions attempts, partners,
and parameters can be treated on a per-group basis for accuracy and
efficiency.  "Per-grid computes"_compute.html also use mixture groups
to calculate per-grid quantities on a per-grid-cell, per-group basis,
i.e. on subsets of particles within each grid cell.

If the {group} keyword is not used in a mixture command, no changes to
group assignements are made for species that are already in the
mixture.  If one or more new species are specified, then all of them
are assigned to a group with "default" as the group ID.  Note that
this means that mixtures defined with mixture commands that never use
the {group} keyword will have just a single group.

If the {group} keyword is used, the group ID can be any string you
choose.  Similar to the mixture ID, it can only contain alphanumeric
characters and underscores.  Using SELF for the group ID has a special
meaning as discussed below.

The operation of the {group} keyword depends on whether no species or
some species are specified explicitly in the mixture command.  It also
depends on whether the group ID is SELF or a user-defined name.  In
each case, after the operation is done, any group IDs for the mixture
that have no species assigned to them are deleted.  This includes the
"default" group if it was implicitly created by a previous mixture
command.

If no species are listed in the mixture command and the group ID is
SELF, then every species already in the mixture is assigned to a group
with its species ID as the group ID.  I.e. there will now be one
species per group. :ulb,l

If one or more species are listed and the group ID is SELF, then each
listed species is assigned to a group with its species ID as the group
ID. :l

If no species are listed and the group ID is not SELF, then all
species already in the mixture are assigned to a group with the
specified ID. :l

If one or more species are listed and the group ID is not SELF, then
the listed species are all assigned to a group with the specified
ID. :l,ule

:line

These keywords operate on one or more mixtures.

The {copy} keyword creates a new mixture with {new-ID} which is
an identical copy of the mixture with {ID}.  Regardless of where
the {copy} keyword appears in the command, the operation
is delayed until all other keywords have been invoked.

This is useful if you wish to create a new mixture which is nearly the
same as the current mixture.  Subsequent mixture commands can be used
to change the properties of the new mixture.

The {delete} keyword removes one or more species from the mixture,
specified as {sp1}, {sp2}, etc.  No other keywords can be used with
{delete}.  All arguments that follow it are assumed to be species IDs
that are currently in the mixture.  When using {delete}, no species
can be defined before the keyword, i.e. {species1}, {species2}, etc
cannot be defined in the comand syntax described above.

After the listed species are removed, any group IDs for the mixture
that have no species assigned to them are also deleted.

:line

[Restrictions:]

The restrictions on use of the {delete} keyword are described above.

[Related commands:]

"global"_global.html, "create_particles"_create_particles.html

[Default:]

The {nrho}, {vstream}, and {temp} defaults are those defined for the
background gas density, as set by the "global"_global.html command.
The {trot} and {tvib} defaults are to use the thermal temperature
{temp}, either its default or the value specified by this command.
The {frac} default is described above.  The {group} keyword has no
default; if it is not used, new species not already in the mixture are
assigned to a group with a group ID = "default".
