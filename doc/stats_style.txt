[Examples:]

[Description:]

Determine what statistical data is printed to the screen and log file.

The values printed by the various keywords are instantaneous values,
calculated on the current timestep.  The exception is the keywords
suffixed by "ave", which print a running total divided by the number
of timesteps.

Options invoked by the "stats_modify"_stats_modify.html command can
be used to set the numeric precision of each printed value, as well as
other attributes of the statistics.

The {step} and {elapsed} keywords refer to timestep count.  {Step} is
the current timestep.  {Elapsed} is the number of timesteps elapsed
since the beginning of this run.  {Elaplong} is the number of
timesteps elapsed since the beginning of an initial run in a series of
runs.  See the {start} and {stop} keywords for the "run"_run.html
command for info on how to invoke a series of runs that keep track of
an initial starting time. If these keywords are not used, then
{elapsed} and {elaplong} are the same value.

The {cpu} keyword is elapsed CPU seconds since the beginning of this
run.  The {tpcpu} and {spcpu} keywords are measures of how fast your
simulation is currently running.  The {tpcpu} keyword is simulation
time per CPU second, where simulation time is in time
"units"_units.html.  The {spcpu} keyword is the number of timesteps
per CPU second.  Both quantities are on-the-fly metrics, measured
relative to the last time they were invoked.  Thus if you are printing
out statistical output every 100 timesteps, the two keywords will
continually output the time and timestep rate for the last 100 steps.

The {wall} keyword is elapsed time in seconds since SPARTA was
launched.  This can be used to time portions of the input script in
the following manner:

variable            t equal wall
variable            t1 equal $t
portion of input script
variable            t2 equal $t
variable            delta equal v_2-v_1
print               "Delta time = ${delta}" :pre

:line

The {np}, {ntouch}, {ncomm}, {nbound}, {nexit}, {nscoll}, {nscheck},
{ncoll}, {nattempt}, {nreact}, and {nsreact} keywords all generate
counts for the current timestep.

The {npave}, {ntouchave}, {ncommave}, {nboundave}, {nexitave},
{nscollave}, {nscheckave}, {ncollave}, {nattemptave}, {nreactave}, and
{nsreactave} keywords all generate values that are the cummulative
total of the corresponding count divided by {elapsed} = the number of
timesteps since the start of the current run.

The {np} keyword is the number of particles.

The {ntouch} keyword is the number of cells touched by the particles
during the move portion of the timestep.  E.g. if a particle moves
from cell A to adjacent cell B, it touches 2 cells.

The {ncomm} keyword is the number of particles communicated
to other processors.

The {nbound} keyword is the number of particles that collided with a
global boundary.  Crossing a periodic boundary or exiting an outflow
boundary is not counted.

The {nexit} keyword is the number of particles that exited the
simulation box through an outflow boundary.

The {nscoll} keyword is the number of particle/surface collisions that
occurred, where a particle collided with a geometric surface.

The {nscheck} keyword is the number of particle/surface collisions
that were checked for.  If a cell is overlapped by N surface elements,
all N must be checked for collisions each time a particle in that cell
moves.

The {ncoll} keyword is the number of particle/particle collisions that
occurred.

The {nattempt} keyword is the number of particle/particle collisions
that were attempted.

The {nreact} keyword is the number of chemical reactions that
occurred.  The {nsreact} keyword is the number of chemical reactions
on surfaces that occurred, including the global boundaries if they are
treated as reacting surfaces, via the "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html
command.

The {vol} keyword is the volume (or area in 2d) of the simulation box.

The {lx}, {ly}, {lz} keywords are the dimensions of the simulation
box.

The {xlo}, {xhi}, {ylo}, {yhi}, {zlo}, {zhi} keywords are the
boundaries of the simulation box.

For the following keywords, the ID in the keyword should be replaced
by the actual ID of a surface collision model, surface reaction model,
compute, fix, or variable name that has been defined elsewhere in the
input script.  See those commands for details.  If the entity
calculates a global scalar, vector, or array, then the keyword formats
with 0, 1, or 2 brackets will reference a scalar value from the
entity.

The {s_ID\[I\]} and {r_ID\[I\]} keywords allow global values
calculated by a surface collision model or surface reaction model to
be output.  As discussed on the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html and
surf_react"_surf_react.html doc pages, these models both calculate a
global vector of quantities.
 
The {c_ID} and {c_ID\[I\]} and {c_ID\[I\]\[J\]} keywords allow global
values calculated by a compute to be output.  As discussed on the
 "compute"_compute.html doc page, computes can calculate global,
per-particle, per-grid, or per-surf values.  Only global values can be
referenced by this command.  However, per-particle, per-grid, or
per-surf compute values can be referenced in a
 "variable"_variable.html and the variable referenced, as discussed
below.
 
The {f_ID} and {f_ID\[I\]} and {f_ID\[I\]\[J\]} keywords allow global
values calculated by a fix to be output.  As discussed on the
"fix"_fix.html doc page, fixes can calculate global, per-particle,
per-grid, or per-surf values.  Only global values can be referenced by
this command.  However, per-particle or per-grid or per-surf fix
values can be referenced in a "variable"_variable.html and the
variable referenced, as discussed below.

The {v_name} keyword allow the current value of a variable to be
output.  The name in the keyword should be replaced by the variable
name that has been defined elsewhere in the input script.  Only
equal-style variables can be referenced.  See the
"variable"_variable.html command for details.  Variables of style
{equal} can reference per-particle or per-grid or per-surf properties
or stats keywords, or they can invoke other computes, fixes, or
variables when evaluated, so this is a very general means of creating
statistical output.

See "Section_modify"_Section_modify.html for information on how to add
new compute and fix styles to SPARTA to calculate quantities that can
then be referenced with these keywords to generate statistical output.
