<H3>compute gas/collision/grid command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID gas/collision/grid group-ID mix-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>gas/collision/grid = style name of this compute command
<LI>group-ID = group ID for which grid cells to perform calculation on
<LI>mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 gas/collision/grid all all

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Count the number of gas-phase collisions bewteen pairs of particles
which occur in each grid cell during the current timestep.  Only gas
collisions which do not result in chemical reactions are counted by
this command.  See the related <A HREF = "compute_gas_reaction_grid.html">compute
gas/reaction/grid</A> command to count
collisions which induce reactions.
</P>
<P>Only collisions within grid cells in the grid group specified by
<I>group-ID</I> and pairs of particles with both species in the mixture
specified by <I>mix-ID</I> are included.  See the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A>
command for info on how grid cells can be assigned to grid groups.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command or used as inputs to the <A HREF = "compute_reduce.html">compute
reduce</A> command.  The values can also be time
averaged by the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A> command.

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid vector with the count of collisions
for each grid cell.
</P>
<P>The vector can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 6.4</A>
for an overview of SPARTA output options.
