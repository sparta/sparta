fix custom command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID custom Nfreq style action args ... action args ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
custom = style name of this fix command
Nfreq = reset custom values every this many steps
style = {particle} or {grid} or {surf}
action args = all remaining args are identical to those defined for the "custom"_custom.html command :ul

[Examples:]

variable dvec particle (x+y)/2.0
custom particle create dvec double 0
custom surf create temp double 0 create vstream double 3

fix 1 custom 1000 particle set dvec v_dvec air NULL
fix 1 custom 10000 surf file surf.temp.* 1 temp file surf.vstream.* 3 vstream\[1\] vstream\[2\] vstream\[3\]
fix 1 custom 10000 surf file surf.flow.* 4 temp vstream\[1\] vstream\[2\] vstream\[3\]

[Description:]

Reset one or more custom attributes for particles, grid cells, or
surface elements.  This operation is performed once every {Nfreq}
timesteps.

The syntax for {actions} and their arguments are the same as for the
"custom"_custom.html command with two differences.

First, only the {set}, {file}, and {file/coarse} actions are supported
for this fix.  The {create} and {remove} actions are not, since they
do not make sense to perform multiple times during a run.

Second, the {file} and {file/coarse} actions take a filename as an
argument.  The filename must contain a wildcard "*" character which
will be replaced by the timestep.  This is to allow a sequence of
files to be read during the simulation.  The filename wildcard "*"
cannot be used with the "custom"_custom.html command.

All of the actions supported by this command reset the values of
custom attribute(s) which must already exist.  See the
"custom"_custom.html and "read_surf"_read_surf.html and
"read_grid"_read_grid.html commands for different ways to define and
initialize custom attributes.

Note that the resetting of attributes by this fix takes place at the
end of timesteps determined by {Nfreq}.  If custom attributes are
output by a "dump"_dump.html command on the same timestep, that takes
place after this fix has performed the reset.  This means that if this
fix and a dump command both reset/output every 1000 steps, then a dump
file snapshot for step 3000 could include custom attributes which were
reset at the end of step 3000.  But the new attribute values will not
influence particles or grid cells or surface elements until the
following step 3001 and beyond.

Also note that this command DOES NOT reset attribute values at the
beginning of any run, even if an input script contains multiple
"run"_run.html commands.  For example, if {Nfreq} = 1000 and the input
script performs a series of 10000-step runs, then no resetting of
attributes takes place (due to this command) on timestep 0, before the
first run.  Likewise, between runs, this command DOES reset attribute
values at the end of the last step (10000, 20000, etc) of each run,
but DOES NOT reset them again before the first step of the next run.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If needed, resetting of custom values can be performed
before the first run or between runs using the "custom"_custom.html
command.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If {Nfreq} triggers the reading of a file on the last
step of the last run in the input script, then the
wildcard-substituted filename (explained below) must exist.  This is
the case, even though the new values will have no effect in the
current input script, since there are no subsequent timestep
operations which will use them.  Note, however that if a restart file
is written on the last timestep, or following the last run, the
updated custom values will be written to the restart file.
