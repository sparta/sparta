[Description:]

Read the geometry of a surface from the specified file.  In SPARTA, a
"surface" is a collection of surface elements that represent the
surface of one or more physical objects which will be embedded in the
global simulation box.  Surfaces can be explicit or implicit.  This
command reads implicit surfaces from a file containing grid corner
point values which implicitly define the surface elements.  See the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command to read explicit surfaces from a
different kind of file.  See the "Howto
6.13"_Section_howto.html#howto_13 section of the manual for an
explantion of explicit versus implicit surfaces as well as distributed
versus non-distributed storage.  You cannot mix explicit and implicit
surfaces in the same simulation.

Surface elements are triangles in 3d or line segments in 2d.  Surface
elements for each physical object are required to be a complete,
connected set that tile the entire surface of the object.  See the
discussion of watertight surfaces below.  Implicit surfaces will
always be watertight, due to the algorithm that defines them.

Particles collide with surface elements as they advect.  Each surface
element is assigned to a collision model, specified by the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command which affects how a particle
bounces off the surface.  Each surface element can optionally be
assigned to a reaction model, specified by the
"surf_react"_surf_react.html command which determines if any surface
chemistry occurs during a collision.  Statistics for each surface
element due to their interactions with particles can be tallied via
the "compute isurf/grid"_compute_isurf_grid.html command,
time-averaged via the "fix ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command, and
ouput via the "dump surface"_dump.html command.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The "compute isurf/grid"_compute_isurf_grid.html
command has not yet been implemented.

Surface elememts can be assigned to surface groups via the "group
surf"_group.html command.  Surface group IDs are used by other
commands to operate on selected sets of elements.  This command has a
{type} keyword which can be used to help assign different elements to
different groups.

Note that the read_isurf command can be used multiple times to read
multiple objects from multiple files and add them to the simulation
domain, so long as the grid extent of the different commands does not
overlap.  The format of a surface file for implicit surfaces is
discussed below.

The tools directory contains a implicit_grid.py tool which can create
implicit surface files in a randomized manner for different grid
extents.

The specified {group-ID} must be the name of a grid cell group, as
defined by the "group grid"_group.html command, which contains a set
of grid cells, all of which are the same size, and which comprise a
contiguous 3d array, with specified extent {Nx} by {Ny} by {Nz}.  For
2d simulations, {Nz} must be specified as 1, and the group must
comprise a 2d array of cells that is {Nx} by {Ny}.  These are the grid
cells in which implicit surfaces will be created.

The specified {filename} is for a binary file in the following format:

first 4 bytes = Nxfile (integer)
next 4 bytes = Nyfile (integer)
next 4 bytes = Nzfile (integer), only for 3d simulations
final N bytes = Nxfile by Nyfile by Nzfile grid corner point values (integer) :ul

For 2d simulations, the first 8 bytes store 2 integers in binary
format: Nxfile and Nyfile.  For 3d simulations, the first 12 bytes
store 3 integers in binary format: Nxfile, Nyfile, and Nzfile.  These
are the dimensions of the grid of corner point values in the remainder
of the file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Nxfile, Nyfile, Nzfile values are for a 2d or 3d
grid of corner points, which overlay the Nx by Ny by Nz grid of cells.
In each dimension there is one more corner point than cells.  Thus
Nxfile = Nx+1, Nyfile = Ny+1, Nzfile = Nz+1 is required.  SPARTA will
give an error if the read_isurf Nx,Ny,Nz arguments do not match the
first 2 or 3 integers in the file.

The remaining N bytes of the file are a series of one-byte integer
values.  There are N = Nxfile * Nyfile values in 2d, and N = Nxfile *
Nyfile * Nzfile values in 3d.  Each value is a single byte integer
from 0 to 255 inclusive.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The corner point values are a 2d or 3d regular array
which must be ordered as follows.  The x indices (1 to Nxfile) vary
fastest, then the y indices (1 to Nyfile), and the z indices slowest
(1 to Nzfile).  These will be assigned as corner points to each child
grid cell in the Nx by Ny by Nz simulation domain.  For mapping corner
points to grid cells, the ordering of the regular array of grid cells
in the simulation domain is the same: their x indices vary fastest,
then y, and their z indices very slowest.

The 8 corner point values (4 in 2d) for each grid cell are used with a
marching cubes algorithm (marching squares in 2d) to infer a set of
triangles (line segments in 2d) which are created in each grid cell.

IMPORTANT NOTE: All triangles (line segments in 2d) created within the
same grid cell are assigned the same surface ID, which is the grid
cell ID.

A good description of the two algorithms is given on these Wikipedia
webpages:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares :ul

The algorithms require a threshold value as input, which is the
{thresh} value in the read_isurf command.  For corner point values
that bracket the threshold, it determines precisely where in the grid
cell the corner points of the inferred implicit surface(s) will be.

The threshold must be specified as a floating point value such that 0
< thresh < 255.  An integer value for thresh (e.g. 128 or 128.0) is
not allowed, because that could induce implicit surfaces with zero
length (2d line) or area (3d triangle).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The aggregate set of implicit surfaces created by this
procedure must represent a watertight object(s), the same as explained
for the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command, otherwise SPARTA will
generate an error.  The marching cube and square algorithms guarantee
this.  However, if the Nx by Ny by Nz array of grid cells is interior
to the simulation box, the entire outer boundary of the Nxfile by
Nyfile by Nzfile grid of corner points should have values = 0.  This
will insure no surface element touches that outer boundary (which
would induce a non-watertight surface).  If the array of grid cells
touches the simulation box face, then this is not a requirement (the
same as if a set of explicit surfs were clipped at the box boundary).
However, if a boundary is periodic in a particular dimension and the
array of grid cells touches that boundary, then you must insure the
Nxfile by Nyfile by Nzfile grid of corner points spans that entire
dimension, and its values are periodic in the same sense the
simulation box is.  E.g. if the y dimension is periodic, then the
corner point values at the y = 1 and y = Nyfile lines or planes of the
2d or 3d corner point array must be identical.  Otherwise the
aggregate set of implicit surfaces will not be consistent across the y
periodic boundary.

The following optional keywords affect group and type settings for the
read-in surface elements and output of the elements.

Surface groups are collections of surface elements.  Each surface
element belongs to one or more surface groups; all elements belong to
the "all" group, which is created by default.  Surface group IDs are
used by other commands to identify a group of suface elements to
operate on.  See the "group surf"_group.html command for more details.

Every surface element also stores a {type} which is a positive
integer.  {Type} values are useful for flagging subsets of elements.
For example, implicit surface elemnts in different regions of the
simulation box.  Surface element types can be used to define surface
groups.  See the "group surf"_group.html command for details.

The {group} keyword specifies an extra surface {group-ID} to which to
assign all the implicit surface elements created by the read-in file.
All the created implicit elements are assigned to the "all" group and
to {group-ID}.  If {group-ID} does not exist, a new surface group is
created.  If it does exist the create implicit surface elements are
added to that group.

The {type} keyword triggers the reading of a per grid cell type file
with the specified name {tfile}.  

The specified {filename} is for a binary file in the following format:

first 4 bytes = Nxfile (integer)
next 4 bytes = Nyfile (integer)
next 4 bytes = Nzfile (integer), only for 3d simulations
final N bytes = Nxfile by Nyfile by Nzfile grid corner point values (integer) :ul

For 2d simulations, the first 8 bytes store 2 integers in binary
format: Nxfile and Nyfile.  For 3d simulations, the first 12 bytes
store 3 integers in binary format: Nxfile, Nyfile, and Nzfile.  These
are the dimensions of the grid of corner point values in the remainder
of the file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Nxfile, Nyfile, Nzfile values are for a 2d or 3d
grid of per-cell values, which overlay the Nx by Ny by Nz grid of
cells.  Thus Nxfile = Nx, Nyfile = Ny, Nzfile = Nz is required.
SPARTA will give an error if the read_isurf Nx,Ny,Nz arguments do not
match the first 2 or 3 integers in the file.

The remaining N bytes of the file are a series of one-byte integer
values.  There are N = Nxfile * Nyfile values in 2d, and N = Nxfile *
Nyfile * Nzfile values in 3d.  Each value is a single byte integer
from 1 to 255 inclusive, since surface element type values must be >
0.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The corner point values are a 2d or 3d regular array
which must be ordered as follows.  The x indices (1 to Nxfile) vary
fastest, then the y indices (1 to Nyfile), and the z indices slowest
(1 to Nzfile).  These will be assigned to each grid cell in the Nx by
Ny by Nz simulation domain.  For mapping type values to grid cells,
the ordering of the regular array of grid cells in the simulation
domain is the same: their x indices vary fastest, then y, and their z
indices very slowest.

The type value for each grid cell is used to assign a type value to
each surface element created in that grid cell by the marching cubes
or squares algorithm.

If the {file} keyword is used, the surfaces will be written out to the
specified {filename} immediately after they are read in.  The
arguments for this keyword are identical to those used for the
"write_surf"_write_surf.html command.  This includes a file name with
optional "*" and "%" wildcard characters, as well as its optional
keywords.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The {file} keyword must be the last keyword specified
with the read_isurf command.  This is because all the remaining arguments
are passed to the "write_surf"_write_surf.html command.

The format for the output file is the same as the one written by the
"write_surf"_write_surf.html command, or that is read by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  This can be useful for
visualizing the implicit surfaces with a tool that uses SPARTA surface
data as input.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you write out implicit surfaces via the {file}
keyword, they are written as if they were explicit surfaces.  Thus the
file can only be read back into SPARTA via the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command, which will treat them as explicit
surfaces.  At some point we will add a write_isurf command, so that
dynamics implicit surfaces can be written in a format that allows them
be be read back in as implicit surfaces.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the "create_box"_create_box.html command, and after a grid has been
created by the "create_grid"_create_grid.html command.  If particles
already exist in the simulation, you must insure particles do not end
up inside the set of implicit surfaces.

"read_surf"_read_surf.html, "write_surf"_write_surf.html

[Default:]

The optional keyword defaults are group = all and type = no.
