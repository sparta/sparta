compute sonine/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID sonine/grid mix-ID keyword values ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
sonine/grid = style name of this compute command :l
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :l
one or more keywords may be appended, multiple times :l
keyword = {a} or {b} :l
values = values for specific keyword :l
  {a} args = dim order = sonine A moment
    dim = {x} or {y} or {z}
    order = number from 1 to 5
  {b} args = dim2 order = sonine B moment
    dim2 = {xx} or {yy} or {zz} or {xy} or {yz} or {xz}
    order = number from 1 to 5 :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 sonine/grid air a x 5 b xy 5 :pre

These commands will dump 10 time averaged sonine moments for each
species and each grid cell to a dump file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 sonine/grid species a x 5 b xy 5
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1\[*\]
dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.grid id f_1\[*\] :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the sonine moments of the
velocity distribution of the particles in each grid cell.  The values
are tallied separately for each group of species in the specified
mixture, as described in the Output section below.  See the mixture
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump grid"_dump.html command.

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command.  It does its averaging as if the
particles in the cell at each sampling timestep were combined together
into one large set of particles to compute the A,B formulas below.

Note however that the center-of-mass (COM) velocity that is subtracted
from each particle to yield a squared thermal velocity Csq for each
particle, as described below, is the COM velocity for only the
particles in the current timestep.  When time-averaging it is NOT the
COM velocity for all particles across all timesteps.

Note that this is a different form of averaging than taking the values
produced by the formulas below for a single timestep, summing those
values over the sampling timesteps, and then dividing by the number of
sampling steps.

Calculation of both the A and B sonine moments is done by first
calcuating the center-of-mass (COM) velocity of particles for each
group.  This is done as follows:

COMx = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
COMy = Sum_i (mass_i Vy_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
COMz = Sum_i (mass_i Vz_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
Cx = Vx - COMx
Cy = Vy - COMy
Cz = Vz - COMz
Csq = Cx*Cx + Cy*Cy + Cz*Cz :pre

The COM velocity is (COMx,COMy,COMz).  The thermal velocity of each
particle is (Cx,Cy,Cz), i.e. its velocity minus the COM velocity of
particles in its group and cell.  This allows computation of Csq for
each particle which is used in the formulas below to calculate the
sonine moments.

:line

The {a} keyword calculates the average of one or more sonine A moments
for all particles in each group:

A1 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim * pow(Csq,1)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
A2 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim * pow(Csq,2)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
A3 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim * pow(Csq,3)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
A4 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim * pow(Csq,4)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
A5 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim * pow(Csq,5)) / Sum_i (mass_i) :pre

Vdim is Vx or Vy or Vz as specified by the {dim} value.  {Csq} is the
squared thermal velocity of the particle, as in the COM equations
above.  The number of moments computed is specified by the {order}
value, e.g. for order = 3, the first 3 moments are computed, which
leads to 3 columns of output as explained below.

The {b} keyword calculates the average of one or more sonine B moments
for all particles in each group:

B1 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,1)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
B2 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,2)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
B3 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,3)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
B4 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,4)) / Sum_i (mass_i)
B5 = Sum_i (mass_i * Vdim1 * Vdim2 * pow(Csq,5)) / Sum_i (mass_i) :pre

Vdim is Vx or Vy or Vz as specified by the {dim} value.  {Csq} is the
squared thermal velocity of the particle, as in the COM equations
above.  The number of moments computed is specified by the {order}
value, e.g. for order = 2, the first 2 moments are computed, which
leads to 2 columns of output as explained below.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
{a z 3} and {b xy 2} moments were specified as keywords, then the 1st
thru 3rd columns would be the A1, A2, A3 moments of the first group,
the 4th and 5th columns would be the B1 and B2 moments of the first
group, the 6th thru 8th columns would be the A1, A2, A3 moments of the
2nd group, etc.

This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See "Section 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  These
could be unsplit or cut cells (if they have zero flow volume).  Both
of these kinds of cells will compute a zero result for all their
values.  Likewise, split cells store no particles and will produce a
zero result.  This is because their sub-cells actually contain the
particles that are geometrically inside the split cell.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-grid array values will be in the "units"_units.html
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  These are
units like velocity cubed or velocity to the 6th power.
