read_grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

read_grid filename :pre

filename = name of grid file :ul

[Examples:]

read_grid data.grid :pre

[Description:]

Read a grid file in text format which lists the grid cell IDs to be
used to construct a hierarchical grid that overalys the simulation
domain defined by the "create_box"_create_box.html command.  The grid
can also be defined by the "create_grid"_create_grid.html command.

The grid file can be written by the "write_grid"_write_grid.html
command in a previous simulation, or be created by some pre-processing
tool.  See "Section 6.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual for
a definition of hierarchical grids and grid cell IDs as used by
SPARTA.

The specified file can be a text file or a gzipped text file (detected
by a .gz suffix).  See the "write_grid"_write.grid.html command for a
description of the format of the file.

The grid cell IDs read from the file to processors in a round-robin
fashion, which means in general the set of cells a processor owns will
not be contiguous in a geometric sense.  They are thus assumed to be a
"dispersed" assignment of grid cells to each processor.

IMPORTANT NOTE: See "Section 6.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the
manual for an explanation of clumped and dispersed grid cell
assignments and their relative performance trade-offs.  The
"balance_grid"_balance_grid.html command can be used after the grid is
read, to assign child cells to processors in different ways.  The "fix
balance" command can be used to re-assign them in a load-balanced
manner periodically during a running simulation.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the "create_box"_create_box.html command.

To read gzipped grid files, you must compile SPARTA with the
-DSPARTA_GZIP option - see "Section 2.2"_Section_start.html#start_2 of
the manual for details.
