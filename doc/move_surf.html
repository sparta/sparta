<H3>move_surf command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>move_surf groupID style args ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>group-ID = 

<PRE>style = <I>file</I> or <I>trans</I> or <I>rotate</I>
  <I>file</I> args = filename entry
  <I>trans</I> args = Dx Dy Dz
    Dx,Dy,Dz = displacement applied to all surface points (distance units)
  <I>rotate</I> args = theta Rx Ry Rz Ox Oy Oz 
    theta = rotate surface points by this angle in counter-clockwise direction (degrees)
    Rx,Ry,Rz = rotate around vector starting at origin pointing in this direction
    Ox,Oy,Oz = origin to rotate around (distance units)

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command performs a one-time movement of all the surface elements
in the specified group via the specified style.  This command can be
invoked as many times as desired, before or between simulation runs.
Surface points can also be moved on-the-fly during a simulation by
using the <A HREF = "fix_move_surf.html">fix move/surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>Moving surfaces between simulations can be useful if you want to
perform a series of runs from one input script, where some attribute
of the surface elements change, e.g. the separation between two
spheres.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>file</I> style is not yet implemented.  It will
allow new positions of points to be listed in a file.
</P>
<P>In 2d, surface elements are line segments with 2 vertices each.  In
3d, surface elements are triangles with 3 vertices each.  If a line
segment or triangle belongs to the specified group, all of its
vertices are moved.  This effectively moves the entire surface
element.  Note that if two (or more) surface elements share the same
vertex and one (or more) of the elements is not in the specified
group, the shape of that surface element may also be affected, since
only some of its vertices may move.
</P>
<P>The <I>trans</I> style shifts or displaces each vertex by the vector
(Dx,Dy,Dz).
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate</I> style rotates the coordinates of all vertices by an angle
<I>theta</I> in a counter-clockwise direction, around the vector starting
at (Ox,Oy,Oz) and pointing in the direction <I>Rx,Ry,Rz</I>.  Any desired
rotation can be represented by an appropriate choice of (Ox,Oy,Oz),
<I>theta</I>, and (Rx,Ry,Rz).
</P>
<P>After the surface has been moved, then all particles in grid cells
that meet either of these criteria are deleted:
</P>
<UL><LI>the grid cell is now inside a surface
<LI>the grid cell overlaps with a surface element that moved 
</UL>
<P>This is to prevent particles from ending up inside surface objects.
</P>
<P>Note that in this context, "overlaps" means that any part of the
surface element touches any part of the grid cell, including its
surface.  Also note that if a surface element object (e.g. a sphere)
moved a long distance then grid cells that were inside the object in
its old position and thus contained no particles, will still have no
particles immediately after the move.  This will effectively leave a
"void" in the flow until particles re-fill the grid cells that are now
outside the object.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>An error will be generated if any surface element vertex is
moved outside the simulation box.
