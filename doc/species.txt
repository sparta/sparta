[Description:]

Define one or more particle species to use in the simulation.  This
command can be used as many times as desired to add species to the
list of species that the simulation recognizes.

The specified {file} is the name of a file containing definitions for
a list of species, not all of which need to specified in this command,
or used in a simulation.  Only those requested by ID will be extracted
from the file and they must be present in the file.  The format of the
species file is discussed below.  The data directory in the SPARTA
distribution contains several species files, all with the suffix
".species".

Each {ID} is a character string used to identify the species, such as
N or O2 or NO or D or Fe-.  The string can be any combination of
alphanumeric characters or "+", "-", or underscore.

Instead of specifying IDs for single species, one of several
pre-defined multi-species names can be used, each of which is expanded
into a list of several individual species IDs.  The list of currently
recognized abbreviations is as follows:

air = N, O, NO :ul

These abbreviations can be used in combination with single-species IDs
as in the 3rd example above.

:line

The format of a species file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines
are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.
All other lines must have the following format with values separated
by whitespace:

species-ID prop1 prop2 ... prop9 prop10 :pre

The species-ID is a string that will be matched against the requested
species-ID, as described above.  The properties are as follows:

prop1 = molecular weight (atomic mass units, e.g. 16 for oxygen)
prop2 = molecular mass (mass units)
prop3 = rotational degrees of freedom (integer, unitless)
prop4 = inverse rotational relaxtion number (unitless)
prop5 = vibrational degrees of freedom (integer, unitless)
prop6 = inverse vibrational relaxation number (unitless)
prop7 = vibrational temperature (temperature units)
prop8 = species weight (unitless)
prop9 = multiple of electon charge (1 for a proton) :ul

The allowed values for rotational degrees of freedom (rotdof = prop3)
are 0,2,3.  Typically, 0 = monatomic species, 2 = diatomic, 3 =
anything else.

The allowed values for vibrational degrees of freedom (vibdof = prop5)
are 0,2,4,6,8.  The associated number of vibrational modes is vibdof
divided by 2.  Typically, 0 modes = monatomic species, 1 mode =
diatomic, 2/3/4 modes = triatomic or larger molecules.

Note that all the listed rotational and vibrational values must be
specified for each species, but in cases where they are not used by
SPARTA, they can simply be specified as 0.0.  Whether or not the
values are used for a species depends on the value of rotdof and
vibdof.  Whether the values are used in a simulation also depends on
the settings specified for the {rotation} and {vibration} keywords of
the "collide_modify"_collide_modify.html command.

Specifically, if prop3 for rotdof = 0, then prop4 is ignored.  If
prop5 for vibdof = 0, then prop6 and prop7 are ignored.

If vibdof = 4,6,8, then information for 2,3,4 vibrational modes can be
specified for the species in a separate file using the optional
{vibfile} keyword, as discussed below.  If the "collide_modify
vibration"_collide_modify.html command is used with a setting of
{discrete}, then this vibrational mode info must be specified for each
species with a vibdof = 4,6,8.  Note that the "fix
vibmode"_fix_vibmode.html command must also be used to allocate
per-particle storage for these additional modes.

NOTE: By default the maximum allowed number of vibrational modes is 4
(dof = 8). If you have a model with species which need more, you can
change the settings at the top of src/particle.h in the enum command
for MAXVIBMODE=4 to a larger value and re-compile the code.  The
format of the {vibfile}, as described next, is then enhanced
accordingly.

:line

The optional {vibfile} keyword can be used to specify additional
vibrational information in the specified {vfile}.  If this option is
used, then an entry must appear in {vfile} for every species in this
command with a vibdof value = 4,6,8.  Note that even if this
vibrational info is read, it is ignored by SPARTA unless the
"collide_modify vibrate"_collide_modify.html setting is specified as
{discrete}.

The format of a species vibrational file is as follows.  See
data/co2.species.vib for an example. Comments or blank lines are
allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.  All
other lines must have the following format with values separated by
whitespace:

species-ID N temp1 relax1 degen1 temp2 relax2 degen2 ... tempN relaxN degenN :pre

The species-ID is a string that will be matched against the requested
species-ID, as described above.  N is the number of vibrational modes
that follow, which must be either 2,3,4, and must match the
corresponding vibdof value = 4,6,8 (divided by two) used in the
species file.

For each of the N modes, 3 values are listed:

tempI = vibrational temperature of mode I (temperature units)
relaxI = inverse vibrational relaxation number of mode I (unitless)
degenI = degeneracy of mode I (integer, unitless) :ul

These quantities are used during collisions if vibrational energy is
modeled in discrete levels.

Note that the values for temp1 and relax1 override the same values
defined in the species file (prop7 and prop6) when they are listed for
the same species in the {vibfile}.

:line

The keywords {SWS} or {SWSmax} trigger the use of the species weighting
scheme. prop8 from the species file is used to modify the ratio of 
physical particles to simulation particles for the corresponding 
species-ID. 

The species weights are defined as: wi=prop8 (0<prop8<=1). The ratio 
is calculated then for every species i: wi*fnum.

Using a weight equal to 1 for every species is equivalent to a 
conventional simulation, where every species is simulated with the 
same ratio of physical particles to simulation particles. However,
the number of numerical particles of a species can be increased 
when using a weight smaller than 1. Using the species weighting scheme 
typically allows the simulation of trace species, such as ions and 
electrons, with very small mole fractions in a neutral particle 
mixture.

The conservation of momentum and energy upon the impact of differently
weighted particles is ensured by Boyd's splitting-merging method
described in "(Boyd96)"_#Boyd96. 

Note: chemical reactions occurring when two differentially weighted 
particles collide are implemented only for a single group mixture. The
ambipolar assumption is also enabled. Multiple mixture groups feature and
surface reactions are not yet implemented when using SWS. 
Furthermore, as reactants are deleted by the reaction, it is not 
possible to use the splitting-merging approach. Instead, each reactant 
and product is associated with a probability to remain or be created 
according to their weights. 

When using the species weighting scheme, the particle species collision
rates can deviate from the expectation as the particle species
distribution does not follow the mixture mole fraction anymore. It 
is recommended to always maintain a ratio of 10 major species to 1
trace species simulation particles to avoid any significant deviation 
on the physical accuracy of the simulation. 

Using the {SWSmax} keyword prevents this limitation by modifying 
the total number of attempted collisions and the acceptance-rejection
probability of a selected pair to collide using the maximum value 
of the pair particle weights to obtain accurate physical particle
collision rates. The computational effort increases
slightly due to the increase in attempted collisions, but this
method gives accurate results even for a ratio of 1 major species to
1 trace species simulation particle. Details can be found in 
"(Rjasanow2005)"_#Rjasanow2005.
