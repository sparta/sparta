[Description:]

Emit particles from a face of the simulation box, continuously during
a simulation.  The particles are added using properties of the
specified mixture and values read from an input file that can override
the default global values for those properties.  In particular, the
input file can be used to create an influx of particles that varies
spatially over the surface of the {face}.  This can be useful, for
example, to model an object inserted into a plume flow where the flow
has spatially varying properties.  If invoked every timestep, this fix
creates a continuous influx of particles thru the face.

The properties of the added particles are determined by the mixture
with ID {mix-ID} and the input file.  Together they set the number and
species of added particles, as well as their streaming velocity,
thermal temperature, and internal energy modes.  Settings for a
subsonic pressure boundary condition is also allowed.  The details are
explained below.

Only one face of the simulation box can be specified via the {face}
argument.  The 6 possible faces are {xlo}, {xhi}, {ylo}, {yhi}, {zlo},
or {zhi}.  This command can be used multiple times to add particles on
multiple faces.

On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with a face touching the
specified boundary {face} performs the following computations to add
particles.  The particles are added at the beginning of the SPARTA
timestep.

The molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of "(Bird94)"_#Bird94.  The number of particles {M} to
add on a particular grid cell face is based on this flux and
additional global, flow, and cell face properties:

global property: {fnum} ratio as specified by the "global"_global.html" command
flow properties: number density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature
cell face properties: area of face and its orientation relative to the streaming velocity :ul

The flow properties are defined for the specified mixture via the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.  Any or all them can be overridden by
values in the input data file, which affect individual grid cells as
described below.

If {M} has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are
added, and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.  Each
particle is added at a random location on the grid cell face.  The
particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the {frac} settings
of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.  These can also be overridden by
spatially varying number fraction values in the input data file, as
described below.

The velocity of the particle is set to the sum of the streaming
velocity and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature.
The internal energy modes of the particle are determined by the {trot}
and {tvib} settings and the {rotate} and {vibrate} options of the
"collide_modify"_collide_modify.html command.  Note that if the
"collide"_collide.html command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.

If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling procedure is repeated until it is.  This
insures that all added particles enter the simulation domain, as
desired.

The first timestep that added particles are advected, they move for a
random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow field
of particles entering the simulation box.

For 3d simulations, the input data file defines a 2d [mesh of points]
which conceptually overlays some portion or all of the specified face
of the simulation box.  For a 2d simulation, a 1d [mesh of points] is
defined.  The set of mesh points is topologically regular, but can
have uniform or non-uniform spacing in each of its two or one
dimensions (for 3d or 2d problems).  One or more values can be defined
at every mesh point, which override any of the mixture settings
defined by the "mixture"_mixture.html command.  These are the flow
properties discussed above (number density, streaming velocity, and
thermal temperature), as well as the number fraction of any species in
the mixture.  Any value not defined in the input data file defaults to
the mixture value.

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is critical to understand that the input data file
defines [mesh points] on the face of the simulation box.  It does not
define [mesh cells], e.g. 2d squares or rectangles, each with flow
properties.

For 3d simulations, 2d mesh points are defined in the file using I,J
indices.  (The 1d mesh points for 2d simulations are described below).
I and J map to any of the simulation box faces in this manner.  A
simulation box face has two varying dimensions (e.g. ylo face = x and
z dimensions).  The I index in the file corresponds to the "lowest" of
these dimensions, where x < y < z.  The J index in the file
corresponds to the higher.  Thus for face ylo, I = x and J = z.  A low
I or J value corresponds to a low x or z value, regardless of whether
the mapping is to the ylo or yhi face.  1d mesh points for a 2d
simulation are defined in an analogous manner, e.g. for face xlo, I =
y.

For a 3d simulation, interpolation from values on the 2d mesh points
to any grid cell face that is on the corresponding simulation box face
is done in the following manner.  There are 3 cases to consider.

(a) For a grid cell face that is entirely inside the area defined by
the file mesh points, the centroid (center point) of the grid cell
face is surrounded geometrically by 4 mesh points.  The 4 values
defined on those 4 points are averaged in a weighted manner using
bilinear interpolation (described below) to determine the value for
the grid cell face.  This value is then used for the calculation
described above for {M} = the number of particles to add on the cell
face as well as the properties of the added particles.

(b) For a grid cell face that is entirely outside the area defined by
the file mesh points, no particles are added in that grid cell.

(c) For a grid cell face that partially overlaps the area defined by
the file mesh points, the extent of the overlap is computed.  The
centroid (center point) of the overlap area is surrounded
geometrically by 4 mesh points.  The values for those 4 points are
used as in (a) above to determine properties of particles added in
that grid cell.  Note that the area of insertion, used to calculate
{M}, is the overlap area, which is smaller than the grid cell face
area.  Also, particles are only added within the overlap area of the
grid cell face.

For a 2d simulation, the 3 cases are similar, except for (a) and (c)
the centroid is the midpoint of a line segment, the centroid is
surrounded by 2 mesh points, and linear interpolation (described
below) is performed to determine the value for the grid face.

The format of the input data file is a series of one or more sections,
defined as follows (without the parenthesized comments).  Note that
one file can contain many sections, each with a different set of
tabulated values.  The sections can be a mix of 2d and 3d formats.
SPARTA reads the file section by section, skipping sections with
non-matching boundary IDs, until it finds one that matches the
specified boundary-ID.  The lines that follow must be in this order:

# plume ABC info           (one or more comment or blank lines) :pre

PLUME_ABC                  (boundary-ID is first word on line)
NIJ 4 10                   (mesh size: Ni by Nj points)
NV 3                       (Nv = number of values per mesh point)
VALUES nrho temp Ar        (list of Nv values per mesh point)
IMESH 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.0      (mesh point coordinates in I direction)
JMESH ...                  (mesh point coordinates in J direction)
                           (blank)
1 1 1.0 300.0 0.5          (I, J, value1, value2, ...)
1 2 1.02 310.0 0.5           
...
4 10 3.0 400.0 0.7 :pre

This format is for a 3d simulation.  For a 2d simulation, there are 3
changes:

"NIJ 4 10" is replaced by "NI 6"
JMESH line is not included
"I,J,value1,..." is replaced by "I,value1,..." :pre

A section begins with a non-blank line whose first character is not a
"#".  Blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.  The first line begins with a boundary-ID which
identifies the section.  The line can contain additional text, but the
initial text must match the boundary-ID specified in the fix
emit/face/file command.  Otherwise the section is skipped.

The VALUES line lists Nv keywords.  The list of possible keywords is
as follows, along with the meaning of the numeric value specified for
the mesh point:

nrho = number density
vx,vy,vz = 3 components of streaming velocity
temp = thermal temperature
trot = rotational temperature
tvib = vibrational temperature
press = pressure for subsonic boundary condition
species = number fraction of any species in the mixture :ul

The IMESH and JMESH lines must list values that are monotonically
increasing.

Following a blank line, the next N = Ni x Nj lines (or N = Ni lines
for a 2d simulation) list the tabulated values.  The format of each
line is I,J followed by Nv values.  The N lines can be in any order,
but all unique I,J (or I for 2d) indices must be listed.

Note that if number fractions are specified for one or more species in
the mixture, then they override number fraction values for the mixture
itself, as set by the "mixture"_mixture.html command.  However, for
each grid cell, the rule that the number fraction of all species in
the mixture must sum to 1.0 is enforced, just as it is for the
mixture.  This means that number fractions of species not specified in
the file or in the mixture may be reset (for that grid cell) to insure
the sum = 1.0, as explained on the "mixture"_mixture.html command doc
page.  If this cannot be done, an error will be generated.

If the {press} keyword is used, this means a subsonic pressure
boundary condition is used for the face, similar to how the {subsonic}
keyword is used for the "fix emit/face"_fix_emit_face.html command.
If just the {press} keyword is specified, but not the {temp} keyword,
then it is similar to the "subsonic press NULL" setting for the "fix
emit/face"_fix_emit_face.html command.  If both keywords are used it
is similar to the "subsonic press temp" setting for the "fix
emit/face"_fix_emit_face.html command.  The difference with this
command is that both the {press} and {temp} values can be vary
spatially across the box face, like the other keyword values.

The subsonic pressure boundary condition is uses the method of Fang
and Liou "(Fang02)"_#Fang02 to determine the number of particles to
insert in each grid cell on the emitting face(s).  They used the
method of characteristics to calculate the mean properties of the
incoming molecular flux, so that the prescribed pressure condition is
achieved.  These properties are then applied to calculate the
molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time, as given by
equation 4.22 of "(Bird94)"_#Bird94.

As explained above the input data file can specify both the pressure
and temperature at the boundary or just the pressure.  If specified,
the temperature must be > 0.0.  Currently, instantaneous values for
the density, temperature, and stream velocity of particles in the
cells adjacent to the boundary face(s) are computed and used to
determine the properties of inserted particles on each timestep.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Caution must be exercised when using the subsonic
boundary condition without specifying an inlet temperature. In this
case the code tries to estimate the temperature of the flow from the
properties of the particles in the domain. If the domain contains few
particles per cell it may lead to spurious results.  This boundary
condition is meant more for an outlet than an inlet boundary
condition, and performs well in cases where the cells are adequately
populated.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When using a subsonic prsesure boundary condition, you
should also use an appropriate boundary collision or chemistry model
via the "boundary"_boundary.htmo or "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html
or "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html or "surf_react"_surf_react.html
commands, so that particles hitting the surface disappear as if they
were exiting the simulation domain.  That is necessary to produce the
correct subsonic conditions that the particle insertions due to this
command are trying to achieve.

For 3d simulations, bilinear interpolation from the 2d mesh point
values specified in the file is performed using this equation to
calculate the value at the centroid point (i,j) in the grid cell face:

f(i,j) = 1/area * (f(i1,j1)*(i2-i)*(j2-j) + f(i2,j1)*(i-i1)*(j2-j) +
                   f(i2,j2)*(i-i1)*(j-j1) + f(i1,j2)*(i2-i)*(j-j1)) :pre

where the 4 surrounding mesh points are (i1,j1), (i2,j1), (i2,j2), and
(i1,j2).  The 4 f() values on the right-hand side are the values
defined at the mesh points.  The sum is normalized by the area of the
overlap between the grid cell face and the file mesh.

For 2d simulations, linear interpolation from the 1d mesh point values
specified in the file is performed using this equation to calculate
the value at the centroid point (i) in the grid cell line:

f(i) = 1/length * (f(i1)*(i2-i) + f(i2)*(i-i1)
     = f(i1) + (i - i1)/(i2 - i1) * (f(i2) - f(i1)) :pre

where the 2 surrounding mesh points are (i1) and (i2).  The 2 f()
values on the right-hand side are the values defined at the mesh
points.  The sum is normalized by the length of the overlap between
the grid cell line and file mesh.

The {frac} keyword can alter how many particles are added, which
can be useful for debugging purposes.  If {frac} is set to 1.0 (the
default) then the number of particles added is the sum of the {M}
values computed for each grid cell that overlaps with the mesh defined
in the file, as described above.  If {frac} < 1.0 then {M} is scaled
by frac to determine the number of particles added in each grid
cell.  Thus a simulation with less particles can easily be run to test
if it is setup correctly.

The {nevery} keyword determines how often particles are added.  If
{Nstep} > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.

The {perspecies} keyword determines how the species of each added
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of added particles.

If {perspecies} is set to {yes}, then a target insertion number {M} in
a grid cell is calculated for each species, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the "mixture
nfrac"_mixture.html command.  If {M} has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be added,
and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.

If {perspecies} is set to {no}, then a single target insertion number
{M} in a grid cell is calculated for all the species.  Each time a
particle is added, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if {M} has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be added, and a 13th
depending on the value of a random number.

Here is a simple example that illustrates the difference between the
two options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative
number fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell adds 10
particles from that mixture.  If {perspecies} is set to {yes}, then
exactly 5 particles of each species will be added on every timestep
insertions take place.  If {perspecies} is set to {no}, then exactly
10 particles will be added every time and on average there will be 5
particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep it might be
6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep it might be 3
of the first and 7 of the second.

If the {region} keyword is used, then a particle will only added if
its position is within the specified {region-ID}.  This can be used to
only allow particle insertion on a subset of the boundary face.  Note
that the {side} option for the "region"_region.html command can be
used to define whether the inside or outside of the geometric region
is considered to be "in" the region.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles added on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number added since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.

[Restrictions:]

Particles cannot be added on periodic faces of the simulation box.
Particles cannot be added on {z} faces of the simluation box for a 2d
simulation.

Unlike the "fix emit/face"_fix_emit/face.html command, no warning is
issued if the specified emission face has an inward normal in a
direction opposing the streaming velocity, as defined by the mixture.
This is because the streaming velocity as defined by the specified
mixture may be overridden by values in the file.  

For that grid cell, particles will still be emitted from that face, so
long as a small fraction have a thermal velocity large enough to
overcome the outward streaming velocity, so that their net velocity is
inward.  The threshold for this is the thermal velocity for particles
3*sigma from the mean thermal velocity.

[Related commands:]

"mixture"_mixture.html, "create_particles"_create_particles.html, "fix
emit/face"_fix_emit_face.html

[Default:]

The keyword defaults are frac = 1.0, nevery = 1, perspecies = yes,
region = none.
