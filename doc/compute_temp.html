<H3>compute temp/kk command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID temp 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>temp = style name of this compute command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>compute 1 temp
compute myTemp temp 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperature of all particles.
</P>
<P>The temperature is calculated by the formula KE = dim/2 N kB T, where
KE = total kinetic energy of the particles (sum of 1/2 m v^2), dim =
dimensionality of the simulation, N = number of particles, kB =
Boltzmann constant, and T = temperature.
</P>
<P>Note that this definition of temperature does not subtract out a net
streaming velocity for particles, so it is not a thermal temperature
when the particles have a non-zero streaming velocity.  See the
<A HREF = "compute_thermal_grid.html">compute thermal/grid</A> command for
calculation of thermal temperatures on a per grid cell basis.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature).  This value
can be used by any command that uses global scalar values from a
compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 6.4</A> for an
overview of SPARTA output options.
</P>
<P>The scalar value will be in temperature <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.

<P>Styles with a <I>kk</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
