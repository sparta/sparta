compute react/isurf/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID react/isurf/grid group-ID reaction-ID value1 value2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
react/isurf/grid = style name of this compute command :l
group-ID = group ID for which grid cells to perform calculation on :l
reaction-ID = ID of surface reaction model which defines surface reactions :l
zero or more values can be appended :l
value = {r:s1/s2/s3 ...} or {p:s1/s2/s3 ...} :l
  r: or p: = list of reactant species or product species
  s1,s2,s3 = one or more species IDs, separated by "/" character :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_react air prob air.surf
compute 1 react/isurf/grid all air
compute 2 react/isurf/grid all air r:N/O/N2/O2 p:N/O/NO :pre

These commands will dump time averages for each grid cell to a dump
file every 1000 steps:

compute 2 react/isurf/grid all air r:N/O/N2/O2 p:N/O/NO
fix 1 ave/grid all 10 100 1000 c_2\[*\]
dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.surgrid id f_1\[*\] :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that tallies counts of reactions for each grid
cell containing implicit surface elements, based on the particles that
collide with those elements.  Only grid cells in the grid group
specified by {group-ID} are included in the tallying.  See the "group
grid"_group.html command for info on how grid cells can be assigned to
grid groups.  Likewise only grid cells with surface elements assigned
to the surface reaction model specified by {reaction-ID} are included
in the tallying.  This assignment is done via the
"surf_modify"_surf_modify.html command.

Implicit surface elements are triangles for 3d simulations and line
segments for 2d simulations.  Unlike explicit surface elements, each
triangle or line segment is wholly contained within a single grid
cell.  See the "read_isurf"_read_isurf.html command for details.

This command can only be used for simulations with implicit surface
elements.  See the similar "compute
react/surf"_compute_react_surf.html command for use with simulations
with explicit surface elements.

Note that when a particle collides with a surface element, it can
bounce off (possibly as a different species), be captured by the
surface (vanish), or a 2nd particle can also be emitted.

The doc page for the "surf_react"_surf_react.html command explains the
different reactions that can occur for each specified style.

If no values are specified each reaction specified by the
"surf_react"_surf_react.html style is tallied individually for each
grid cell.

If M values are specified, then M tallies are made for each grid cell,
one per value.  If the value starts with "r:" then any reaction which
occurs with one (or more) of the listed species as a reactant is
counted as part of that tally.  If the value starts with "p:" then any
reaction which occurs with one (or more) of the listed species as a
product is counted as part of that tally.  Note that these rules mean
that a single reaction may be tallied multiple times depending on
which values it matches.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump grid"_dump.html command.

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
either equal to the number of reactions defined by the
"surf_react"_surf_react style (if no values are specified) or equal to
M = the # of values specified.

Grid cells not in the specified {group-ID} or whose implicit surfaces
are not assigned to the specified {reaction-ID} will output zeroes for
all their values.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 6.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-grid array values are counts of the number of reactions that
occurred on surface elements in that grid cell.
