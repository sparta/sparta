write_isurf command :h3

[Syntax:]

write_isurf group-ID Nx Ny Nz filename ablateID keyword args ... :pre

group-ID = group ID for which grid cells store the implicit surfs :ulb,l
Nx,Ny,Nz = grid cell extent of the grid cell group :l
filename = name of file to write grid corner point info to :l
ablateID = ID of the "fix ablate"_fix_ablate.html command which stores the corner points :l
zero or more keyword/args pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {precision} :l
  precision arg = int or double :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

write_isurf block 100 100 200 isurf.material.* ablation :pre

[Description:]

Write a grid corner point file in binary format describing the current
corner point values which define the current set of implicit surface
elements.  See the "read_isurf"_read_surf.html command for a
definition of implicit surface elements and how they are defined from
grid conner point values.  The surface file can be used for later
input to a new simulation or for post-processing and visualization.

The specified {group-ID} is the name of a grid cell group, as defined
by the "group grid"_group.html command, which contains a set of grid
cells, all of which are the same size, and which comprise a contiguous
3d array, with specified extent {Nx} by {Ny} by {Nz}.  These should be
the same parameters that were used by the "read_isurf"_read_isurf.html
command, when the original grid corner point values were read in and
used to define a set of implicit surface elements.  For 2d
simulations, {Nz} must be specified as 1, and the group must comprise
a 2d array of cells that is {Nx} by {Ny}.  These are the grid cells
that contain implicit surfaces.

Similar to "dump"_dump.html files, the {filename} can contain a "*"
wildcard character.  The "*" character is replaced with the current
timestep value.  For example isurf.material.0 or
isurf.material.100000.

The specified {ablateID} is the fix ID of a "fix
ablate"_fix_ablate.html command which has been previously specified in
the input script for use with the "read_isurf"_read_isurf.html command
and (optionally) to perform ablation during a simulation.  It stores
the grid corner point values for each grid cell.

The output file is written in the same binary format as the
"read_isurf"_read_isurf.html command reads in.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"read_isurf"_read_isurf.html

[Default:]

The optional keyword default is precision double.
