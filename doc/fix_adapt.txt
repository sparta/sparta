fix adapt command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID adapt Nfreq args ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
adapt = style name of this fix command
Nfreq = perform grid adaptation every this many steps
args = all remaining args are identical to those defined for the "adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html command :ul

[Examples:]

NOTE: need some better examples

fix 1 adapt 1000 refine particle 10 50
fix 1 adapt 500 coarsen particle 10 50
fix 1 adapt 10000 refine coarsen value c_1[1] 5.0 10.0 iterate 2 :pre

[Description:]

This command performs on-the-fly adapatation of grid cells as a
simulation runs, either by efinement or coarsening or both.  Grid
adaptation can also be performed before or between simulations by
using the "adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html command.

Refinement means splitting one child cell into multiple new child
cells; the original child cell becomes a parent cell.  Coarsening
means combining all the child cells of a parent cell into a single new
child cell.  See "Section howto 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 for a
description of the hierarchical grid used by SPARTA and a defintion of
child and parent cells.

Grid adaptation can be useful for adjusting the grid cell sizes to the
current density distribution or mean-free-path of particles or to
other simulation attributes such as the presence of surface elements.
A well-adapted grid can improve accuracy of the simulation and reduce
its computational cost.

Adaptation is performed by this command once every {Nfreq} timesteps.

All of the command arguments that determine how adapation is done, for
both refinement and coarsening, are exactly the same as for the
"adapt_grid"_adapt-grid.html command.  See its doc page for all the
details.

The one exception is that the {iterate} keyword cannot be used with
the fix adapt command.  Only a single iteration of the action1 and
action2 parameters (described on the "adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html doc
page) can be performed each time grid adaptation is performed.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix computes a global scalar which is a flag for whether any grid
adaptation actually occured on the last timestep it was invoked.  The
value of the flag is 1 if any cells were refined or coarsened, else it
is 0.
