fix ave/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID ave/grid Nevery Nrepeat Nfreq value1 value2 ... keyword args ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
ave/grid = style name of this fix command :l
Nevery = use input values every this many timesteps :l
Nrepeat = # of times to use input values for calculating averages :l
Nfreq = calculate averages every this many timesteps
zero or more input values can be listed :l
value = c_ID, c_ID\[i\], f_ID, f_ID\[i\], v_name :l
  c_ID = per-grid vector (or array) calculated by a compute with ID
  c_ID\[I\] = Ith column of per-grid array calculated by a compute with ID
  f_ID = per-grid vector (or array) calculated by a fix with ID
  f_ID\[I\] = Ith column of per-grid array calculated by a fix with ID :pre
zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {ave}
  {ave} args = one or running
    one = output a new average value every Nfreq steps
    running = accumulate average continuously :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all ave/grid 10 20 1000 c_mine
fix 1 all ave/grid 1 100 100 c_2 ave running :pre

These commands will dump averages for each species and each grid cell
to a file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
dump 1 grid 1000 tmp.grid id f_1 :pre

[Description:]

Use one or more per-grid vectors as inputs every few timesteps, and
average by grid cell over longer timescales, applying appropriate
normalization factors.  The resulting per grid cell averages can be
used by other output commands such as the "dump grid"_dump.html
command.

Each input value can be the result of a "compute"_compute.html or
"fix"_fix.html.  The compute or fix must produce a per-grid vector or
array, not a global or per-particle or per-surf quantity.  If you wish
to time-average global quantities from a compute, fix, or variable,
then see the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.  To
time-average per-surf quantities, see the "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html command.

"Computes"_compute.html that produce per-grid vectors or arrays are
those which have the word {grid} in their style name.  See the doc
pages for individual "fixes"_fix.html to determine which ones produce
per-grid vectors or arrays. 

Each per-grid value of each input vector is averaged independently.

:line

The {Nevery}, {Nrepeat}, and {Nfreq} arguments specify on what
timesteps the input values will be used in order to contribute to the
average.  The final averaged quantities are generated on timesteps
that are a multiple of {Nfreq}.  The average is over {Nrepeat}
quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the simulation every
{Nevery} timesteps.  {Nfreq} must be a multiple of {Nevery} and
{Nevery} must be non-zero even if {Nrepeat} is 1.  Also, the timesteps
contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nfreq >
(Nrepeat-1)*Nevery is required.

For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.

If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the compute calculates a per-grid vector, then the
per-grid vector is used.  If {c_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in
the range from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column
per-grid array calculated by the compute.  If {c_ID} is used, and the
compute calculates a per-grid array, then it is the same as if the
individual columns of the array had been listed one by one.

E.g. these 2 fix ave/grid commands are equivalent, since the "compute
grid"_compute_grid.html command produces 3 columns of output using the
{all} mixture-ID which has a single group:

compute 1 grid all n u usq
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1\[1\] c_1\[2\] c_1\[3\] :pre

Users can also write code for their own compute styles and "add them
to SPARTA"_Section_modify.html.

If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, and the fix calculates a per-grid vector, then the per-grid
vector is used.  If {f_ID\[N\]} is used, then N must be in the range
from 1-M, which will use the Nth column of the M-column per-grid array
calculated by the fix.  If {f_ID} is used, and the fix calculates a
per-grid array, then it is the same as if the individual columns of
the array had been listed one by one.  See the example above for
computes.

Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps,
which must be compatible with {Nevery}, else an error will result.

For averaging of a value that comes from a compute or fix,
normalization is performed as follows.  If the compute or fix is
summing over particles in a grid cell to calculate a per-grid quantity
(e.g. energy or temperature), this takes the form of a numerator
divided by a denominator.  For example, see the formulas discussed on
the "compute grid"_compute_grid.html doc page, where the denominator
is 1 (for keyword n), or the number of particles (ke, mass, temp), or
the sum of particle masses (u, usq, etc).  When this command averages
over a series of timesteps, the numerator and denominator are summed
separately.  This means the numerator/denominator division only takes
place when this fix produces output, every Nfreq timesteps.

For example, say the Nfreq output is over 2 timesteps, and the value
produced by "compute grid mass"_compute_grid.html is being averaged.
Say a grid cell has 10 particles on the 1st timestep with a numerator
value of 10.0, and 100 particles on the 2nd timestep with a numerator
value of 50.0.  The output of this fix will be (10+50) / (10+100) =
0.54, not ((10/10) + (50/100)) / 2 = 0.75.

Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix. 

The {ave} keyword determines what happens to the accumulation of
statistics every {Nfreq} timesteps.

If the {ave} setting is {one}, then the values produced on timesteps
that are multiples of Nfreq are independent of each other.
Normalization as described above is performed, and all tallies are
zeroed before accumulating over the next {Nfreq} steps.

If the {ave} setting is {running}, then tallies are never zeroed.
Thus the output at any {Nfreq} timestep is normalized over all
previously accumulated samples since the fix was defined.  The tallies
can only be zeroed by deleting the fix via the unfix command, or by
re-defining the fix, or by re-specifying it.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix produces a per-grid vector or array which can be accessed by
various output commands.  A vector is produced if only a single
quantity is averaged by this fix.  If two or more quantities are
averaged, then an array of values is produced, where the number of
columns is the number of quantities averaged.  The per-grid values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} since that
is when averaging is performed.

This fix performs calculations for all child grid cells in the
simulation, which includes unsplit, split, and sub cells.  "Section
4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_ of the manual gives details of how
SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.

[Restrictions:]

If performing on-the-fly grid adaptation every N timesteps, using the
"fix adapt"_fix_adapt.html command, this fix cannot time-average
across time windows > N steps, since the grid may change.  This means
{Nfreq} cannot be > N, and keyword {ave} = {running} is not allowed.

[Related commands:]

"compute"_compute.html, "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are ave = one.
