package command :h3

[Syntax:]

package style args :pre

style = {kokkos} :ulb,l
args = arguments specific to the style :l
  {kokkos} args = keyword value ...
    zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended
    keywords = {comm} or {reduction}
      {comm} value = {threaded} or {classic}
        threaded = perform pack/unpack using KOKKOS (e.g. on GPU or using OpenMP) (default)
        classic = perform communication pack/unpack in non-KOKKOS mode
      {reduction} = {parallel/reduce} or {atomic}
        parallel/reduce = use parallel reduction for statistics (default)
        atomic = use atomic reduction for statistics
      {collide/extra} = {factor}
        factor = increase memory used for collisions by this factor (default)
      {collide/retry} = {yes} or {no}
        yes = retry collision algorithm until successful
        no = do not retry collision algorithm (default)
      {gpu/direct} = {yes} or {no}
        yes = use GPU-direct, i.e. CUDA-aware MPI (default)
        no = do not use GPU-direct :pre

[Examples:]

package kokkos comm classic
package kokkos comm threaded reduction atomic
package kokkos gpu/direct no :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes package-specific settings for the KOKKOS
accelerator package available in SPARTA.

If this command is specified in an input script, it must be near the
top of the script, before the simulation box has been created.  This
is because it specifies settings that the accelerator package used in
its initialization, before a simulation is defined.

This command can also be specified from the command-line when
launching SPARTA, using the "-pk" "command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6.  The syntax is exactly the same as
when used in an input script.

Note that the KOKKOS accelerator package requires the package command
to be specified, if the package is to be used in a simulation (SPARTA
can be built with the accelerator package without using it in a
particular simulation).  However, a default version of the command is
typically invoked by other accelerator settings. For example, the
KOKKOS package requires a "-k on" "command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6 respectively, which invokes a
"package kokkos" command with default settings.

NOTE: A package command for a particular style can be invoked multiple
times when a simulation is setup, e.g. by the "-k on", "-sf", and
"-pk" "command-line switches"_Section_start.html#start_6, and by using
this command in an input script.  Each time it is used all of the
style options are set, either to default values or to specified
settings.  I.e. settings from previous invocations do not persist
across multiple invocations.

See the the "Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html#acc_3
section of the manual for more details about using the various
accelerator packages for speeding up SPARTA simulations.

The {kokkos} style invokes settings associated with the use of the
KOKKOS package.

All of the settings are optional keyword/value pairs.  Each has a
default value as listed below.

The {reduction} keyword sets the type of reduction used to gather
statistics. The {parallel/reduce} option uses a parallel reduction and
is typically the preferred method when running on CPUs and Xeon Phis.
The {atomic} option uses thread atomics and is typically faster when
running on GPUs.

Chemical reactions can increase the number of particles in the 
simulation, which requires extra memory storage. It is not possible to 
resize Kokkos data structures during the collide routine, so two 
workarounds are provided. The default is to use the {collide/extra} 
keyword, which ensures there is extra memory allocated to store new 
particles. For example, if {collide/extra} is set to 1.1, then the 
memory is over-allocated by 10%. If this space is still not sufficient to hold 
new particles, the code will error out and the simulation must be 
restarted using a larger value for {collide/extra}. Alternatively, if 
the {collide/retry} option is set to {yes}, backup copies of the Kokkos 
data structures are created. If space is exceeded during the collide 
routine, the Kokkos data structures are restored from backup, their size 
is increased, and the collide routine is started over from the 
beginning. This guarantees that the collide routine will eventually 
succeed without producing an error, but increased memory by a factor of 
2 and also has overhead from making a backup copy of the data. If the 
{collide/retry} option is set to {yes}, the {collide/extra} keyword will 
be ignored. If reactions are not defined, both these options will be ignored.

The {comm} keyword determines whether the host or device performs the
packing and unpacking of data when communicating per-atom data between
processors. The value options are {threaded} or {classic}.

The optimal choice for this keyword depends on the hardware used.
When running on CPUs or Xeon Phi, the {classic} option is typically
fastest. When using GPUs, the {threaded} value will typically be
optimal. In this case data can stay on the GPU for many timesteps
without being moved between the host and GPU.  This requires that your
MPI is able to access GPU memory directly.  Currently that is true for
OpenMPI 1.8 (or later versions), Mvapich2 1.9 (or later), and CrayMPI.

The {gpu/direct} keyword chooses whether GPU-direct will be used. When 
this keyword is set to {on}, buffers in GPU memory are passed directly 
through MPI send/receive calls. This can reduce overhead of first 
copying the data to the host CPU. However GPU-direct is not supported on 
all systems, which can lead to segmentation faults and would require 
using a value of {off}.

[Restrictions:]

This command cannot be used after the simulation box is defined by a
"create_box"_create_box.html command.

The kk style of this command can only be invoked if SPARTA was built
with the KOKKOS package.  See the "Making
SPARTA"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

"suffix"_suffix.html, "-pk" "command-line
setting"_Section_start.html#start_6

[Default:]

For the KOKKOS package, the option defaults are comm = threaded, 
reduction = parallel/reduce, collide/extra = 1.1, and collide/retry = 
no, gpu/direct yes. These settings are made automatically by the 
required "-k on" "command-line switch"_Section_start.html#start_6. You 
can change them by using the package kokkos command in your input script 
or via the "-pk kokkos" "command-line switch"_Section_start.html#start_6.
