<PRE>compute 1 reaction/tally all all id/pre id/post id/post2 type/pre type/post type/post2 id/surf time xc yc zc

<P>This command will dump the tallies in the previous command to a dump
file every 10 steps:
</P>
<PRE>dump 1 tally all 10 tmp.tally c_1[*] 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Tally various values for each gas-phase reaction of two particles
during the current timestep.  Only gas collisions which result in a
chemical reactions are tallied by this command, as enabled by the
<A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command.  See the related <A HREF = "compute_gas_collide_tally.html">compute
gas/collide/tally</A> command to tally
collisions which do not induce reactions.  It provides different tally
value options than this compute.
</P>
<P>Only collisions within grid cells in the grid group specified by
<I>group-ID</I> and pairs of particles with both species in the mixture
specified by <I>mix-ID</I> are included.  See the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A>
command for info on how grid cells can be assigned to grid groups.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump tally</A> command.  Currently this is the only option for
accessing the tallied values.
</P>
<P>Note that if a gas-phase reaction takes place then a collision of two
particles can result in 1, 2, or 3 particles being produced.  The
species of the 1, 2, or product particles may be different than the
species of the reactants.  All of these attributes can be tallied
using the values explained next.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>reaction</I> value is the index of which reaction occurred.  It is a
number from 1 to N, where N is the number of reactions defined by the
<A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>id1/pre</I> and <I>id2/pre</I> values are the IDs of the reacting
particles before the reaction.  Note that particle IDs are generated
randomly.  Thus multiple particles in the system can potentially have
the same ID.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more details on
particle IDs.
</P>
<P>The <I>id1/post</I>, <I>id2/post</I>, and <I>id3/post</I> values are the
post-reaction IDs of the 1, 2, or 3 resulting particles.  If one of
the particles vanished in the reaction, then <I>id2/post</I> will be 0.  If
<I>id3/post</I> is 0, no 3rd particle was created by the reaction,
otherwise it is the random ID assigned to the newly created particle.
</P>
<P>The <I>type1/pre</I> and <I>type2/pre</I> value are the integer indices for the
species of the reacting particles before the reaction.  They are
values from 1 to Nspecies.  The values correspond to the order in
which species were defined via the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more details on particle
types.
</P>
<P>The <I>type1/post</I>, <I>type/post2</I>, and <I>type/post3</I> values are the
post-collision integer indices for the particle species of the 0, 1,
or 2 resulting particles.  If one of the particles vanished in the
reaction, then <I>type2/post</I> will be 0.  If <I>type/post3</I> is 0, no 3rd
particle was created by the reaction, otherwise it is the species
index of the newly created particle.
</P>
<P>The values starting with <I>v</I> for particles 1 and 2 with a <I>pre</I> suffix
are the velocity components of the two reacting particles before the
reaction.
</P>
<P>The values starting with <I>v</I> for particles 1 and 2 and 3 with a <I>post</I>
suffix are the velocity components of the 1, 2, or 3 resulting
particles after the reaction.  Velocity components will be zero if the
2nd or 3rd particle does not exist due to the reaction.

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-tally array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-tally values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 6.4</A>
for an overview of SPARTA output options.
</P>
<P>The per-tally array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  All the
velocity components are in velocity units.
</P>
