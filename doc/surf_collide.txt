surf_collide command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_collide ID style args keyword values ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the surface collision model
style = {specular} or {diffuse} :ulb,l
args = arguments for specific style :l
  {specular} args = none
  {diffuse} args = Tsurf acc
    Tsurf = temperature of surface (temperature units)
            Tsurf can be a variable (see below)
    acc = accommodation coefficient :pre
zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {translate} or {rotate} :l
values = values for specific keyword :l
  {translate} args = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = translational velocity of surface (velocity units)
  {rotate} args = Pz Py Pz Wx Wy Wz
    Px,Py,Pz = point to rotate surface around (distance units)
    Wx,Wy,Wz = angular velocity of surface around point (radians/time) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_collide 1 specular
surf_collide 1 diffuse 273.15 0.9
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8 translate 5.0 0.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Define a style for particle-surface collisions.  One or more styles
can be defined and assigned to different surfaces or simulation box
boundaries via the "read_surf"_read_surf.html or
"bound_modify"_bound_modify.html commands.  See "Section
4.9"_Section_howto.html#howto_9 for more details of how SPARTA defines
surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d and
line segments in 2d.

The ID for a surface collisoin model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface collision model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

The {specular} style computes a simple specular reflection model.  It
requires no arguments.  Specular reflection means that a particle
reflects off a surface element with its incident velocity vector
reversed with respect to the outward normal of the surface element.
The particle's speed is unchanged.

:line

The {diffuse} style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.

The model has 2 parameters set by the {Tsurf} and {acc} arguments.
{Tsurf} is the temperature of the surface.  {Acc} is an accommodation
coefficient.

Diffuse reflection emits the particle from the surface with no
dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is assigned to
the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution consistent with the
surface temperature.  The new velocity will have thermal components in the
direction of the outward surface normal and the plane tangent to 
the surface given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_normal.jpg)

The {Tsurf} value can be specified as an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "stats_style"_status_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.

:line

The keyword {translate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.
It models the surface as if it were translating with a constant
velocity, specified by the vector (Vx,Vy,Vz).  This velocity is added
to the final post-collisional velocity of each particle that collides
with the surface.

Note that this keyword is designed for use with flat surfaces, such as
the simulation box wall.  You should define the velocity vector to be
tangential to the surface, with no normal component.  SPARTA does not
check for these conditions.

:line

The keyword {rotate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.  It
models the surface as if it were rotating with a constant angular
velocity, specified by the vector W = (Wx,Wy,Wz), around the specified
point P = (Px,Py,Pz).  When a particle collides with the surface at a
point X = (x,y,z), the collision point has a velocity given by V =
(Vx,Vy,Vz) = W cross (X-P).  This velocity is added to the final
post-collisional velocity of the particle.

This keyword can be used to treat a simulation box boundary as a
rotating wall, e.g. the end cap of an axisymmetric cylinder.  Or to
model a rotating object consisting of surface elements, e.g. a sphere.
In either case, the wall or surface elements themselves do not change
position due to rotation.  They are simply modeled as having a
tangential velocity, as if the entire object were rotating.
