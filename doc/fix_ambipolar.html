<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Enable the ambipolar approximation to be used in a simulation.  The
ambipolar approximation is a computationally efficient way to model
low-density plasmas which contain positively-charged ions and
negatively-charged electrons.  In this model, electrons are not free
particles which move independently.  This would require a simulation
with a very small timestep due to electon's small mass and high speed
(1000x that of an ion or neutral particle).
</P>
<P>Instead each ambipolar electron is assumed to stay "close" to its
parent ion, so that the plasma gas appears macroscopically neutral.
Each pair of particles thus moves together through the simulation
domain, as if they were a single particle, which is how they are
stored within SPARTA.  This means a normal timestep can be used.
</P>
<P>An overview of how to run simulations with the ambipolar approximation
is given in the <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_11">Section 6.11</A>.  This
includes gas-phase collisions and chemistry as well as surface
chemistry when particles collide with surface elements or the global
boundary of the simulation box.  The section also lists all the
commands that can be used in an input script to invoke various options
associated with the ambipolar approximation.  All of them depend on
this fix ambipolar command being defined.
</P>
<P>This command defines <I>especies</I> which is the species ID associated
with the ambipolar electrons.  It also specifies one or more species
IDs as <I>ion1</I>, <I>ion2</I>, etc for ambipolar ions.  SPARTA checks that the
especies has a negative charge (as read in by the
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command), and the ions have positive charges.
An error is flagged if that is not the case.
</P>
<P>Internally, this fix defines two custom particle attributes.  The
first is named "ionambi" and is an integer vector (one integer per
particle).  It stores a value of 1 for ambipolar ions, or 0 otherwise.
The second is named "velambi" and is a floating-point array (3 values
per particle).  It stores the velocity of the ambipolar electron
associated with the ambipolar ion if it exists, or zeroes otherwise.
</P>

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>However, the values of the two custom particle attributes defined by
this fix are written to the restart file.  Namely the integer value
"ionambi" and floating-point velocity values "velambi" for each
particle.  As explained on the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> doc
page these values will be re-assigned to particles when a restart file
is read.  If a new fix ambipolar command is specified in the restart
script before the first <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command is used, then the
ambipolar model will continue to be used in the continued run.
</P>
<P>No global or per-particle or per-grid quantities are stored by this
fix for access by various output commands.
</P>
<P>However, the two custom per-particle attributes defined by this fix
can be accessed by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump particle</A> command, as p_ionambi
and p_velambi.  That means those per-particle values can be written to
particle dump files.

<P>Styles with a <I>kk</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
