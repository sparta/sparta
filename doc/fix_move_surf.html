<H3>fix move/surf command 
</H3>
<H3>fix move/surf/kk command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID move/surf Nevery Nlarge args ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>move/surf = style name of this fix command
<LI>Nevery = move surfaces incrementally every this many steps
<LI>Nlarge = move surfaces the entire distance after this many timesteps
<LI>args = all remaining args are identical to those defined for the <A HREF = "move_surf.html">move_surf</A> command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>fix 1 move/surf 100 1000 all trans 1 0 0
fix 1 move/surf 100 10000 all rotate 360 0 0 1 5 5 0

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command performs on-the-fly movement of a selected set of surface
elements via one of several styles.  Surface element moves can also be
performed before or between simulations by using the
<A HREF = "move_surf.html">move_surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>Moving surfaces during a simulation run can be useful if you want to
to track transient changes in a flow while some attribute of the
surface elements change, e.g. the separation between two spheres.
</P>
<P>All of the command arguments which appear after <I>Nfreq</I>, which
determine which surface elements move and how they move, are exactly
the same as for the <A HREF = "move_surf.html">move_surf</A> command.  See its doc
page for details.
</P>
<P><I>Nevery</I> specifies how often surface elements are moved incrementally
along the path towards their final position.  The current timestep
must be a multiple of <I>Nevery</I>.
</P>
<P><I>Nlarge</I> must be a multiple of <I>Nevery</I> and specifies how long it will
take the surface elements to move to their final position.
</P>
<P>Thus if <I>Nlarge</I> = 100*<I>Nevery</I>, each surface elements will move 1/100 of
its total distance every <I>Nevery</I> steps.
</P>
<P>The same rules that the <A HREF = "move_surf.html">move_surf</A> command follows for
particle deletion after surface elements move, are followed by this
command as well.  The criteria are applied after every incremental
move.  This is to prevent particles from ending up inside surface
objects.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  No global or per-particle or per-grid quantities
are stored by this fix for access by various output commands.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Styles with a <I>kk</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>An error will be generated if any surface element vertex is
moved outside the simulation box.
