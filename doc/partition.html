<H3>partition command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>partition style N command ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>yes</I> or <I>no</I>
<LI>N = partition number (see asterisk form below)
<LI>command = any SPARTA command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>partition yes 1 processors 4 10 6
partition no 5 print "Active partition"
partition yes *5 fix all nve
partition yes 6* fix all nvt temp 1.0 1.0 0.1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command invokes the specified command on a subset of the
partitions of processors you have defined via the -partition
command-line switch.  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">Section 2.6</A> of
the manual for an explanation of the switch.
</P>
<P>Normally, every input script command in your script is invoked by
every partition.  This behavior can be modified by defining world- or
universe-style <A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> that have different values
for each partition.  This mechanism can be used to cause your script
to jump to different input script files on different partitions, if
such a variable is used in a <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> command.
</P>
<P>The "partition" command is another mechanism for having an input
script operate differently on different partitions.  It is basically a
prefix on any SPARTA command.  The commmand will only be invoked on
the partition(s) specified by the <I>style</I> and <I>N</I> arguments.
</P>
<P>If the <I>style</I> is <I>yes</I>, the command will be invoked on any partition
which matches the <I>N</I> argument.  If the <I>style</I> is <I>no</I> the command
will be invoked on all the partitions which do not match the Np
argument.
</P>
<P>Partitions are numbered from 1 to Np, where Np is the number of
partitions specified by the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-partition command-line
switch</A>.
</P>
<P><I>N</I> can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value
can be used, as in the 1st example above.  Or a wild-card asterisk can
be used to span a range of partition numbers.  This takes the form "*"
or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  An asterisk with no numeric values means
all partitions from 1 to Np.  A leading asterisk means all partitions
from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all partitions
from n to Np (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all partitions from
m to n (inclusive).
