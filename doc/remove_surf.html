<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Remove a group of surface elements that have previously been read-in
via the <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command.  The <A HREF = "group.html">group
surf</A> or <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> can be used to assign
each surface element to one or more groups.  This command removes all
surface elements in the specified <I>surfID</I> group.
</P>
<P>Note that the remaining surface elements must still constitute a
"watertight" surface or an error will be generated.  The definition of
watertight is explained in the Restrictions section of the
<A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>After surface elements have been deleted, any surface points that are
no longer part of a surface element are also deleted.  The remaining
surface points and elements are renumbered to create compressed,
contiguous lists.  The new list of surface elements can be output via
the <A HREF = "write_surf.html">write_surf</A> command.
