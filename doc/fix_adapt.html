<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command performs on-the-fly adapatation of grid cells as a
simulation runs, either by refinement or coarsening or both.  Grid
adaptation can also be performed before or between simulations by
using the <A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>Refinement means splitting one child cell into multiple new child
cells; the original child cell becomes a parent cell.  Coarsening
means combining all the child cells of a parent cell, so that the
child cells are deleted and the parent cell becomes a single new child
cell.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section howto 4.8</A> for a
description of the hierarchical grid used by SPARTA and a defintion of
child and parent cells.
</P>
<P>Grid adaptation can be useful for adjusting the grid cell sizes to the
current particle density distribution, or mean-free-path of particles,
or to other simulation attributes such as the presence of surface
elements.  A well-adapted grid can improve accuracy of the simulation
and/or reduce a simulation's computational cost.
</P>
<P>Adaptation is performed by this command once every <I>Nfreq</I> timesteps.
</P>
<P>All of the command arguments which appear after <I>Nfreq</I>, which
determine how adapation is done for both refinement and coarsening,
are exactly the same as for the <A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> command.
See its doc page for details.
</P>
<P>The one exception is that the <I>iterate</I> keyword cannot be used with
the fix adapt command.  Only a single iteration of the action1 and
action2 parameters (described on the <A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> doc
page) can be performed each time grid adaptation is performed.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which is a flag for whether any grid
cells were adapted on the last timestep it was invoked.  The value of
the flag is 1 if any cells were refined or coarsened, else it is 0.
