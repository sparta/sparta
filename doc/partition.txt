partition command :h3

[Syntax:]

partition style N command ... :pre

style = {yes} or {no}
N = partition number (see asterisk form below)
command = any SPARTA command :ul

[Examples:]

partition yes 1 processors 4 10 6
partition no 5 print "Active partition"
partition yes *5 fix all nve
partition yes 6* fix all nvt temp 1.0 1.0 0.1 :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes the specified command on a subset of the
partitions of processors you have defined via the -partition
command-line switch.  See "Section 2.6"_Section_start.html#start_6 of
the manual for an explanation of the switch.

Normally, every input script command in your script is invoked by
every partition.  This behavior can be modified by defining world- or
universe-style "variables"_variable.html that have different values
for each partition.  This mechanism can be used to cause your script
to jump to different input script files on different partitions, if
such a variable is used in a "jump"_jump.html command.

The "partition" command is another mechanism for having an input
script operate differently on different partitions.  It is basically a
prefix on any SPARTA command.  The commmand will only be invoked on
the partition(s) specified by the {style} and {N} arguments.

If the {style} is {yes}, the command will be invoked on any partition
which matches the {N} argument.  If the {style} is {no} the command
will be invoked on all the partitions which do not match the Np
argument.

Partitions are numbered from 1 to Np, where Np is the number of
partitions specified by the "-partition command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6.

{N} can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric value
can be used, as in the 1st example above.  Or a wild-card asterisk can
be used to span a range of partition numbers.  This takes the form "*"
or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  An asterisk with no numeric values means
all partitions from 1 to Np.  A leading asterisk means all partitions
from 1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all partitions
from n to Np (inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all partitions from
m to n (inclusive).
