compute surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID surf mix-ID value1 value2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
boundary = style name of this compute command :l
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :l
one or more values can be appended :l
value = {n} or {press} or {px} or {py} or {pz} or {shx} or {shy} or {shz} or {ke} :l
  n = count of molecules hitting surface element
  press = magnitude of normal pressure on surface element
  px,py,pz = components of normal pressure on surface element
  shx,shy,shz = components of shear stress on surface element
  ke = flux of particle kinetic energy onto surface element :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 surf all n press eng
compute mine surf species press shx shy shz :pre

These commands will dump averages for all species and each surface
element to a file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 boundary species n press shx shy shz
fix 1 ave/surf 10 100 1000 c_1
dump 1 surf 1000 tmp.surf id f_1

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each
surface element, based on the molecules that strike that element.  The
values are summed for each group of species in the specified mixture.
See the "mixture"_mixture.html command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.

Surface elements are triangles for 3d simulations and line segments
for 2d simulatoins.  See the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command for
details.

The results of this compute are used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump surf"_dump.html command.  

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html command.  It does its averaging as if the
molecules striking the surface element at each sampling timestep were
combined together into one large set to compute the formulas below.
The answer is then divided by the number of sampling timesteps if it
is not otherwise normalized by the number of molecules.  Note that
this can be a different normalization than taking the values produced
by the formulas below for a single timestep, summing them over the
sampling timesteps, and then dividing by the number of sampling
timesteps.  However, for the current values below, the two
normalization methods are the same.

The {n} value counts the number of moleclues in the group striking the
surface element.

The {press} value calculates the pressure {P} exerted on the surface
element in the normal direction by molecules in the group, such that
outward pressure is positive.  This is computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
P = Sum_i (p_delta_i dot N) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta is the change in momentum of a particle, whose velocity
changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the surface element.
The pressure exerted on the surface element is the sum over all
contributing p_delta dotted into the outward normal N of the surface
element, normalized by A = the area of the surface element and dt =
the timestep and fnum = the real/simulated particle ratio set by the
"global fnum"_global.html command.

The {px}, {py}, {pz} values calculate the normal pressure Px, Py, Pz
extered on the surface element in the direction of its normal by
molecules in the group, with respect to the x, y, z coordinate axes.
These are computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
p_delta_n = (p_delta dot N) N
Px = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_x) / (A * dt / fnum)
Py = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_y) / (A * dt / fnum)
Pz = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_z) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, and dt are defined as before.
P_delta_n is the normal component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle.  P_delta_n_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z
components.

The {shx}, {shy}, {shz} values calculate the shear pressure Sx, Sy, Sz
extered on the surface element in the tangential direction to its
normal by molecules in the group, with respect to the x, y, z
coordinate axes.  These are computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
p_delta_t = p_delta - (p_delta dot N) N
Sx = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_x) / (A * dt / fnum)
Sy = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_y) / (A * dt / fnum)
Sz = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_z) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, and dt are defined as before.
P_delta_t is the tangential component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle.  P_delta_t_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z
components.

The {ke} value calculates the kinetic energy flux {Eflux} imparted to
the surface element by molecules in the group, such that energy lost
by a particle is a positive flux.  This is computed as

e_delta = 1/2 mass (V_post^2 - V_pre^2)
Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where e_delta is the kinetic energy change in a particle, whose
velocity changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the surface
element.  The energy flux imparted to the surface element is the sum
over all contributing e_delta, normalized by A = the area of the
surface element and dt = the timestep and fnum = the real/simulated
particle ratio set by the "global fnum"_global.html command.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-surf array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
{n} and {u} values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be {n} and {u} for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be {n} and {u} for the second group, etc.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-surf values
from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The per-surf array values will be in the "units"_units.html
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  {Press},
{px}, {py}, {pz}, {shx}, {shy}, {shz} are in in presure units.  {Ke}
is in energy units.
