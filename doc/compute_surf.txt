These commands will dump time averages for each species and each
surface element to a dump file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 surf all species n press shx shy shz
fix 1 ave/surf all 10 100 1000 c_1
dump 1 surf all 1000 tmp.surf id f_1

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each
surface element in a group of elements, based on the particles that
strike that element.  The values are summed for each group of species
in the specified mixture.  See the "mixture"_mixture.html command for
how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.  Only surface
elements in the surface group specified by {group-ID} are included in
the calculations.  See the "group surf"_group.html command for info on
how surface elements can be assigned to surface groups.

Surface elements are triangles for 3d simulations and line segments
for 2d simulatoins.  See the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command for
details.

The results of this compute are used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump surf"_dump.html command.  

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html command.  It does its averaging as if the
particles striking the surface element at each sampling timestep were
combined together into one large set to compute the formulas below.
The answer is then divided by the number of sampling timesteps if it
is not otherwise normalized by the number of particles.  Note that in
general this is a different normalization than taking the values
produced by the formulas below for a single timestep, summing them
over the sampling timesteps, and then dividing by the number of
sampling steps.  However for the current values listed below, the two
normalization methods are the same.

The {n} value counts the number of particles in the group striking the
surface element.

The {press} value calculates the pressure {P} exerted on the surface
element in the normal direction by particles in the group, such that
outward pressure is positive.  This is computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
P = Sum_i (p_delta_i dot N) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta is the change in momentum of a particle, whose velocity
changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the surface element.
The pressure exerted on the surface element is the sum over all
contributing p_delta dotted into the outward normal N of the surface
element, normalized by A = the area of the surface element and dt =
the timestep and fnum = the real/simulated particle ratio set by the
"global fnum"_global.html command.

The {px}, {py}, {pz} values calculate the normal pressure Px, Py, Pz
extered on the surface element in the direction of its normal by
particles in the group, with respect to the x, y, z coordinate axes.
These are computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
p_delta_n = (p_delta dot N) N
Px = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_x) / (A * dt / fnum)
Py = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_y) / (A * dt / fnum)
Pz = - Sum_i (p_delta_n_z) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, and dt are defined as before.
P_delta_n is the normal component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle.  P_delta_n_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z
components.

The {shx}, {shy}, {shz} values calculate the shear pressure Sx, Sy, Sz
extered on the surface element in the tangential direction to its
normal by particles in the group, with respect to the x, y, z
coordinate axes.  These are computed as

p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
p_delta_t = p_delta - (p_delta dot N) N
Sx = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_x) / (A * dt / fnum)
Sy = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_y) / (A * dt / fnum)
Sz = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_z) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, and dt are defined as before.
P_delta_t is the tangential component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle.  P_delta_t_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z
components.

The {ke} value calculates the kinetic energy flux {Eflux} imparted to
the surface element by particles in the group, such that energy lost
by a particle is a positive flux.  This is computed as

e_delta = 1/2 mass (V_post^2 - V_pre^2)
Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where e_delta is the kinetic energy change in a particle, whose
velocity changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the surface
element.  The energy flux imparted to the surface element is the sum
over all contributing e_delta, normalized by A = the area of the
surface element and dt = the timestep and fnum = the real/simulated
particle ratio set by the "global fnum"_global.html command.

The {erot} value calculates the rotational energy flux {Eflux}
imparted to the surface element by particles in the group, such that
energy lost by a particle is a positive flux.  This is computed as

e_delta = Erot_post - Erot_pre
Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where e_delta is the rotational energy change in a particle, whose
internal rotational energy changes from Erot_pre to Erot_post when
colliding with the surface element.  The flux equation is the same as
for the {ke} value.

The {evib} value calculates the vibrational energy flux {Eflux}
imparted to the surface element by particles in the group, such that
energy lost by a particle is a positive flux.  This is computed as

e_delta = Evib_post - Evib_pre
Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) :pre

where e_delta is the vibrational energy change in a particle, whose
internal vibrational energy changes from Evib_pre to Evib_post when
colliding with the surface element.  The flux equation is the same as
for the {ke} value.

The {etot} value calculates the total energy flux imparted to the
surface element by particles in the group, such that energy lost by a
particle is a positive flux.  This is simply the sum of kinetic,
rotational, and vibrational energies.  Thus the total energy flux is
the sum of what is computed by the {ke}, {erot}, and {evib} values.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-surf array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
{n} and {u} values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be {n} and {u} for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be {n} and {u} for the second group, etc.

Surface elements not in the specified {group-ID} will have zeroes for
all their values.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-surf values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-surf array values will be in the "units"_units.html
appropriate to the individual values as described above. {N} is
unitless.  {Press}, {px}, {py}, {pz}, {shx}, {shy}, {shz} are in in
presure units.  {Ke}, {erot}, {evib}, and {etot} are in
energy/area-time units for 3d simulations and energy/length-time units
for 2d simulations.
