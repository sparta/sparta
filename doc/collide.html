<H3>collide command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>collide style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>none</I> or <I>vss</I> 

<LI>args = arguments for that style 

<PRE>  <I>none</I> args = none
  <I>vss</I> args = mix-ID file
    mix-ID = ID of mixture to use for group definitions
    file = filename that lists species with their VSS model parameters 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>collide none
collide vss all.vss background 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define what style of particle-particle collisions will be performed by
SPARTA each timestep.  If collisions are performed, particles are
sorted into grid cells every timestep and the appropriate collision
model is invoked on a per-grid-cell basis.  Collisions alter the
velocity of participating particles as well as their rotational and
vibrational energies.  The rotational and vibrational properties of
each species are set in the file read by the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A>
command.
</P>
<P>The collision style determines how many pairs of particles are
considered for collisions, the criteria for which collisions actually
occurs, and the outcome of individual collision, which alters the
velocities of the two particles.  If chemistry is enabled, via the
<A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command, particles involved in collisions may also
change species, or a particle may be deleted, or a new particle
created.  The <A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command can also be
used to alter aspects of how collisions are performed.  For example,
it can be used to turn on/off the tracking of vibrational energy and
its exchange in collisions.
</P>
<P>A <I>mix-ID</I> argument is specified for each collision style.  It must
contain all the species defined for use by the simulation, via the
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.  The group definitions in the mixture
assign one or more particle species to each group.  These groupings
are used to determine how pairs of particles are chosen to collide
with each other, in the following manner.
</P>
<P>Consider a cell with N particles and a mixture with M groups.  Based
on its species, each particle is assigned to one of the M groups.
Each unique pair of groups is considered, including each group paired
with itself.  For each pair of groups a value <I>Nattempt</I> 
(see equation 11.3 in <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>) is calcualted  
which is the number of collisions to attempt.  This is a function of
N1 and N2 (the number of particles in each group), the grid cell
volume, and other parameters of the collision style.
</P>
<P>For each collision attempt, a random pair of particles is selected,
with one particle from each group.  Whether the collision occurs or
not is a function of the relative velocities of the two particles,
their respectives species, and other parameters of the collision style
(see equation 11.4 in <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>).
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>none</I> style means that no particle-particle collisions will be
performed, i.e. the simulation models free-molecular flow.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>vss</I> style implements the Variable Soft Sphere (VSS) model for
collisions.  As discussed below, with appropriate parameter choices,
it can also compute the Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model. 
(see chapter 2.6 and 2.7  in <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>). 
</P>
<P>In DSMC, the variable-soft-sphere (VSS) interaction of <A HREF = "#Koura92">Koura and
Matsumoto</A> and the variable-hard-sphere (VHS) interaction of
<A HREF = "#Bird94">Bird</A> are used to approximate molecular interactions.  Both
models yield transport properties proportional to a power (omega) of
the gas temperature.  This temperature dependence of the transport
properties is similar to the Inverse Power Law model (IPL) for which
Chapman-Enskog theory provides closed form solutions for the transport
properties.
</P>
<P>Both VSS and VHS interactions define parameters <I>diam</I> = molecular
diameter, which is a function of the molecular speed, and <I>alpha</I> =
angular-scattering parameter, which relates the scattering angle to
the impact parameter.  Setting <I>alpha</I> = 1 produces isotropic (hard
sphere) interactions, which converts the VSS model into a VHS model.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> argument is for a file which contains definitions of VSS
model parameters for some number of species.  It can contain species
not used by this simulation; they will simply be ignored.  All species
currently defined by the simulation must be present in the file.
</P>
<P>The format of the file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines are
allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.  All
other lines must have the following format with properties separated
by whitespace:
</P>
<PRE>species-ID diam omega tref alpha 
</PRE>
<P>The species-ID is a string that will be matched to one of the species
defined by the simulation, via the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.
The meaning of the properties is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>diam = VHS or VSS diameter of particle (distance units)
<LI>omega = temperature-dependence of viscosity (unitless)
<LI>tref = reference temperature (temperature units)
<LI>alpha = angular scattering parameter (unitless) 
</UL>
<P>The methodolgy for deriving VSS/VHS parameters from these properties
is explained in Chapter 3 of <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>.  Parameter values for
the most common gases are given in Appendix A of the same book.  These
values are based on the first-order approximation of the
Chapman-Enskog theory.  Infinite-order parameters are described in
<A HREF = "#Gallis04">(Gallis04)</A>.
