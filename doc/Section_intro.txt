1. Introduction :h3

These sections provide an overview of what SPARTA can do, describe
what it means for SPARTA to be an open-source code, and acknowledge
the funding and people who have contributed to SPARTA.

1.1 What is SPARTA :link(intro_1),h4

SPARTA is a Direct Simulation Montel Carlo code that models rarefied
gases, using collision, chemistry, and boundary condition models.  It
uses a hierarchical Cartesian grid to track and group particles for 3d
or 2d or axisymmetric models.  Objects emedded in the gas are
represented as triangulated surfaces and cut through grid cells.

For examples of SPARTA simulations, see the "SPARTA WWW Site"_sws.

SPARTA runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
machines, but is designed for parallel computers.  It will run on any
parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the "MPI"_mpi
message-passing library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory
parallel machines as well as commodity clusters.

:link(mpi,http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi)

SPARTA can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or
billions.  See "this section"_Section_perf.html for information on SPARTA
performance and scalability, or the Benchmarks section of the "SPARTA
WWW Site"_sws.

SPARTA is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See "this section"_#intro_4 for a
brief discussion of the open-source philosophy.

:link(gnu,http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)

SPARTA is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new capabilities,
such as new collision or chemistry models, boundary conditions, or
diagnostics.  See "this section"_Section_modify.html for more details.

SPARTA is written in C++ which is used at a hi-level to structure the
code and its options in an object-oriented fashion.  The kernel
computations use simple data structures and C-like code for effciency.
So SPARTA is really written in an object-oriented C style.

SPARTA was developed with internal funding at "Sandia National
Laboratories"_snl, a US Department of Energy lab.  See "this
section"_#intro_5 for more information on SPARTA funding and individuals
who have contributed to SPARTA.

1.2 SPARTA features :link(intro_2),h4

This section highlights SPARTA features, with links to specific
commands which give more details.  If SPARTA doesn't have your
favorite collision model, boundary condition, or diagnostic, see "this
section"_Section_modify.html of the manual, which describes how it can
be added to SPARTA.

Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_pizza which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for SPARTA simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in "Python"_python and is available for download from "the
Pizza.py WWW site"_pizza. :l,ule

1.3 Open source distribution :link(intro_3),h4

SPARTA comes with no warranty of any kind.  As each source file states
in its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed free-of-
charge, under the terms of the "GNU Public License"_gnu (GPL).  This
is often referred to as open-source distribution - see
"www.gnu.org"_gnuorg or "www.opensource.org"_opensource for more
details.  The legal text of the GPL is in the LICENSE file that is
included in the SPARTA distribution.

:link(gnuorg,http://www.gnu.org)
:link(opensource,http://www.opensource.org)

Here is a summary of what the GPL means for SPARTA users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend SPARTA in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of SPARTA, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
SPARTA.

(3) If you release any code that includes SPARTA source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.

(4) If you give SPARTA files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.

In the spirit of an open-source code, these are various ways you can
contribute to making SPARTA better.  You can send email to the
"developers"_http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html on any of these
topics.

Point prospective users to the "SPARTA WWW Site"_sws.  Mention it in
talks or link to it from your WWW site. :ulb,l

If you find an error or omission in this manual or on the "SPARTA WWW
Site"_sws, or have a suggestion for something to clarify or include,
send an email to the
"developers"_http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html. :l

If you find a bug, "this section"_Section_errors.html#err_2 describes
how to report it. :l

If you publish a paper using SPARTA results, send the citation (and
any cool pictures or movies) to add to the Publications, Pictures, and
Movies pages of the "SPARTA WWW Site"_sws, with links and attributions
back to you. :l

The tools sub-directory of the SPARTA distribution has various
stand-alone codes for pre- and post-processing of SPARTA data.  More
details are given in "this section"_Section_tools.html.  If you write
a new tool that others will find useful, it can be added to the SPARTA
distribution. :l

SPARTA is designed to be easy to extend with new code for features
like boundary conditions, collision or chemistry models, diagnostic
computations, etc.  "This section"_Section_modify.html of the manual
gives details.  If you add a feature of general interest, it can be
added to the SPARTA distribution. :l

The Benchmark page of the "SPARTA WWW Site"_sws lists SPARTA
performance on various platforms.  The files needed to run the
benchmarks are part of the SPARTA distribution.  If your machine is
sufficiently different from those listed, your timing data can be
added to the page. :l

Cash.  Small denominations, unmarked bills preferred.  Paper sack OK.
Leave on desk.  VISA also accepted.  Chocolate chip cookies
encouraged. :ule,l
