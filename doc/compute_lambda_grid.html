</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command 

<LI>lambda/grid = style name of this compute command

<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 lambda/grid c_GR[*] NULL lambda tau
compute 1 lambda/grid f_ave[*] f_ave[3] lambda knall 
</PRE>
<P>These commands will dump time averages for the mean free path and mean
collision time for each grid cell to a dump file every 1000 steps:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid all species nrho temp
fix 1 ave/grid all 10 100 1000 c_1[*]
compute 2 lambda/grid f_1[*] f_1[2] lambda tau
dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.grid id c_2[*] 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command calculates properties related to the gas collision mean
free path for each grid cell based on the number density <I>nrho</I> and
thermal tempearture <I>temp</I> of particles in the cell.
</P>
<P>If the <I>lambda</I> value is specified, the mean free path (MFP) of
particles between collisions will be computed. If the <I>tau</I> value is
specified, the mean collision time (MCT) between molecular collisions
will be computed.
</P>
<P>If one or more of the <I>knall</I> or <I>knx</I> or <I>kny</I> or <I>knz</I> values are
specified, the dimensionless Knudsen number will be calculated, which
is the ratio of the MFP to the cell size.  For <I>knall</I>, the cell size
is the average of the three grid cell side lengths (or two cell
lengths for a 2d simulation).  For <I>knx</I>, <I>kny</I>, or <I>knz</I>, the cell
size is the single cell side length in the corresponding x,y,z
dimension.
</P>
<P>The Knudsen number can be useful for estimating the optimal grid cell
size when adapting the grid, e.g. via the <A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A>
or <A HREF = "fix_adapt_grid.html">fix adapt/grid</A> commands, as well as for
estimating the optimal timestep size.
</P>
<P>Note that unlike other computes which calculate per-grid values, this
compute does not take a "group-ID" for a grid cell group or a particle
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> ID as an argument.  This is because it uses the
number density and thermal temperature calculated by other computes or
fixes as input, and those computes or fixes use grid group IDs or
mixture IDs as part of their computations.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  For example, the values can be output by the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump
grid</A> command.  Or as indicated above the compute can be
used as an argument for the <A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> or <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix
adapt</A> commands, e.g. to trigger grid cell refinement
or coarsening based on a mean free path metric.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The formula used to calculate the mean free path (lambda) is given in
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> as equation 4.77:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/lambda.png">
</CENTER>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Prior to October 2024, a simpler formula was used for
the mean free path, also from <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>, equation 4.65:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/lambda_old.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The new formula is more accurate as it uses the number densities and
VSS parameters of all gas species (sum over <I>s</I>) in the system, as
opposed to using the total number density and the VSS parameters of
only one species.  This can make a significant difference for gas
mixtures, in particular for reacting flow problems where the
composition of the mixture changes significantly over time.
</P>
<P>The formula used to calculate the mean collision time (tau) is given in
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> as equation 1.38 combined with 4.75:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/tau.png">
</CENTER>
<P>These two formulas are the exact mean free path (MFP) and mean
collision time (MCT) for a multi-species mixture, suitable for
estimating optimal grid cell sizes and timestep as explained above.
</P>
<P>The <I>dref</I> and <I>Tref</I> and <I>omega</I> values in the two formulas are
collision properties for a pair of species in the flow, subscripted as
*pq*.  Specifically, <I>dref</I> is the diameter of molecules of the
species pair, <I>Tref</I> is the reference temperature, and <I>omega</I> is the
viscosity temperature-dependence for the species pair.
</P>
<P>In the two formulas, <I>n_q</I> is the number density of species <I>q</I> within
a grid cell.  <I>T</I> is the thermal temperature of all particles (all
species) in a grid cell.  These per-grid values are specified for use
by this command as the <I>nrho</I> and <I>temp</I> arguments in one of these
forms:
</P>
<PRE>c_ID[*] = compute with ID that calculates nrho for each species as an array output
f_ID[*] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged nrho for each species as an array output 
</PRE>
<PRE>c_ID = compute with ID that calculates temp for all particles a vector output
c_ID[m] = compute with ID that calculates temp for all particles as its Mth column of array output
f_ID = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged temp for all particles as a vector output
f_ID[m] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged temp for all particles as its Mth column of array output 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>temp</I> argument can also be specified as NULL, which drops the
(Tref/T) and (T/Tref) ratios from the two formulas above.
</P>
<P>NOTE for next paragraph: Is it correct that currently, this command
requires that you use a compute grid nrho command which calculates
nrho for every species in the system, not simply every species in a
mixture that the user defines (used as an arg with the compute grid
command) ?  And this is intentional (for accuracy), not a limitation
of the current implementation?
</P>
<P>Note that because the MFP and MFT formulas require a number density
nrho for all species in the system, you should use a <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute
grid</A> command in this form:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid all species nrho 
</PRE>
<P>to reference by this command as c_ID[*].  Or similarly for a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command that takes c_ID[*] as an
argument, which is then referenced by this command as f_ID[*].
</P>
<P>NOTE: check that this next paragraph is correct about the meaning of T
in the 2 formulas.
</P>
<P>For the compute or fix referenced by the <I>temp</I> argument, this is
meant in the two formulas to be the aggregate thermal temperature of
all the particles in a grid cell.
</P>
<P>For systems with a zero of small streaming velocity, this can be calculated
using this command:
</P>
<PRE>compute 2 grid all all temp 
</PRE>
<P>which uses the velocity of each particle to calculate a temperature.
</P>
<P>For systems with a streaming flow, an appropriate therml temperature
can be calculated by the <A HREF = "compute_thermal_grid.html">compute
thermal/grid</A> thermal/grid command.  Its doc
page explain that the the center-of-mass velocity for the particles in
each grid cell is subtracted from each particle's individual velocity
to yield its thermal velocity, from which a thermal temperature is
calculated.  The corresponding command to use with this compute would
be:
</P>
<PRE>compute 2 thermal/grid all all temp 
</PRE>
<P>Note that using fixes, rather than computes, for the <I>nrho</I> and <I>temp</I>
arguments will typically result in less noisy MFP and MCT values, due
to the time averaging which the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A>
command can perform.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the IDs of one or more <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> commands is used for the <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I>
arguments, they only produce output on timesteps that are multiples of
their <I>Nfreq</I> argument.  Thus this compute can only be invoked on
those timesteps.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>If only one output value is specified, this compute outputs a per-grid
vector. Otherwise it outputs a per-grid array with two or more
columns, in the order the output values were specified.
</P>
<P>This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 6.8</A> of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  These
could be unsplit or cut cells (if they have zero flow volume).  Both
of these kinds of cells will compute a zero result for all the
individual values.  Likewise, split cells store no particles and will
produce a zero result.  This is because their sub-cells actually
contain the particles that are geometrically inside the split cell.
</P>
<P>The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid
values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section
4.4</A> for an overview of SPARTA output
options.
</P>
<P>The per-grid values for a column of output for <I>lambda</I> will be in
<A HREF = "units.html">distance units</A>.  A column of output for <I>tau</I> will be
<A HREF = "units.html">time units</A>.  Columns of output for <I>knall</I> or <I>knx</I> or
<I>kny</I> or <I>knz</I> will be dimensionless.
</P>
<P>If the value of <I>nrho</I> for a grid cell is 0.0 (no particles), its MFP
and MCT will be set to 1.0e20 (infinite length and time).  This
"infinite" MFP value will also be used for the calculation of Knudsen
numbers.
</P>

<P>Styles with a <I>kk</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>To use this compute, a collision style must be defined via the
<A HREF = "collide">collide.html</A> command, which defines properties for the
mixture <I>species</I>.
</P>
<P>As explained above, to use this compute with <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I> defined
as input from a <A HREF = "fix">fix_ave_grid.html</A> ave/grid command, this compute
must only be invoked on timesteps that are multiples of the <I>Nfreq</I>
argument used by the fix, since those are the steps when it produces
output.
</P>
<P>One or more output values must be specified. The same output value
cannot be repeated more than once. The <I>knz</I> value cannot but used in
a two-dimensional simulation.
