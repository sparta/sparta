</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the mean free path (lambda)
between molecular collisions for each grid cell, based on the
particles in that cell.  Optionally, a Knudsen number for each cell
can also be calculated, which is the mean free path divided by the
cell size.  These quantities can be useful for estimating the optimal
grid cell size when adapting the grid, e.g. via the
<A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> or <A HREF = "fix_adapt_grid.html">fix adapt/grid</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>Unlike other computes that calculate per grid cell values, this
compute does not take a <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> ID as an argument.
This is because it uses the number density and temperature calculated
by other computes or fixes as input, and those computes or fixes use
mixtures as part of their computations.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  For example, the values can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The formula used to calculate the mean free path (lambda) is given in
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> as equation 4.65:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/lambda.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>This is an approximate mean free path for a multi-species mixture,
suitable for estimating optimal grid cell sizes as explained above.
It is a simplied version of formulas 4.76 and 4.77 from the same
reference.
</P>
<P>Dref and Tref and omega are collision properties for a reference
species in the flow.  The reference species is specified by the
<I>species</I> argument.  It must be a species defined by the
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command and listed in the file of per-species
collision properties read in by the <A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command.
</P>
<P>Specifically, Dref is the diameter of molecules of the species, Tref
is the reference temperature, and omega is the viscosity
temperature-dependence for the species.
</P>
<P>In the formula above, <I>n</I> is the number density and <I>T</I> is the thermal
temperature of particles in a grid cell.  This compute does not
calculate these quantities itself; instead it uses another compute or
fix to perform the calculation.  This is done by specifying the <I>nrho</I>
and <I>temp</I> arguments as either
</P>
<UL><LI>c_ID[m] = compute with ID that calculates nrho/temp as its Mth column of output
<LI>f_ID[m] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged nrho/temp as its Mth column of output 
</UL>
<P>The <I>temp</I> argument can also be specified as NULL, which drops the
(Tref/T) ratio term from the formula above.  That is also effectively
the case if the reference species defines omega = 1/2.  In that case,
the <I>temp</I> argument is ignored, whether it is NULL or not.
</P>
<P>Note that if the value of <I>n</I> is 0.0 for a grid cell, its
mean-free-path will be set to 1.0e20 (infinite length).
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute_grid</A> command can calculate a number
density, using its <I>nrho</I> value.  It can also calculate a temperature
using its <I>temp</I> value.  Note that this temperature is inferred from
the translational kinetic energy of the particles, which is only
appopriate for a mean free path calculation for systems with zero or
small streaming velocities.  For systems with streaming flow, an
appropriate temperature can be calculated by the <A HREF = "compute_thermal_grid.html">compute
thermal/grid</A> command.  The formulas on its
doc page show that the the center-of-mass velocity from the particles
in each grid cell is subtracted from each particle's velocity to yield
a translational thermal velocity, from which a thermal temperature is
calculated.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A> command can calculate the same
values in a time-averaged sense, assuming it uses these same computes
as input.  Using this fix as input to this compute will thus yield
less noisy values, due to the time averaging.
</P>
<P>Note that the compute or fix (via the compute(s) it uses as input) can
perform its number density or temperature calculation for a subset of
the particles based on the "mixture" it uses.  See the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the ID of a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A>
command is used as the <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I> argument, it only produces
output on timesteps that are multiples of its <I>Nfreq</I> argument.  Thus
this compute can only be invoked on those timesteps.  For example, if
a <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command invokes this compute to write values
to a dump file, it must do so on timesteps that are multiples of
<I>Nfreq</I>.
</P>
<P>One of the <I>kall</I> or <I>kx</I> or <I>ky</I> or <I>kz</I> extra arguments can be
optionally appended.  If specified, this calculates an additional
value per grid cell, namely the dimensionless Knudsen number which is
the ratio of the mean free path to the cell size.  For <I>kall</I>, the
cell size is taken to be the average of the three grid cell side
lengths (or two cell lengths for a 2d simulation).  For <I>kx</I>, <I>ky</I>, or
<I>kz</I>, the cell size is the single cell side length in the
corresponding x,y,z dimension.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid vector or array.  If one of <I>kall</I>,
<I>kx</I>, <I>ky</I>, or <I>kz</I> is not specified, then it is a vector.  If one
extra argument is specified, it is an array with two columns.  The
vector or first column of the array is the mean free path; the second
column is the Knudsen number.
</P>
<P>This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 4.8</A> of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  These
could be unsplit or cut cells (if they have zero flow volume).  Both
of these kinds of cells will compute a zero result for all the
individual values.  Likewise, split cells store no particles and will
produce a zero result.  This is because their sub-cells actually
contain the particles that are geometrically inside the split cell.
</P>
<P>The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid
values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section
4.4</A> for an overview of SPARTA output
options.
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values for the vector or first column of the array
will be in distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The second column of the
array will be dimensionless.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>To use this compute, a collision style must be defined via the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command, which defines properties for the
reference <I>species</I>.
</P>
<P>As explained above, to use this compute with <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I> defined
as input from a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A> command, this compute
must only be invoked on timesteps that are multiples of the <I>Nfreq</I>
argument used by the fix, since those are the steps when it produces
output.
