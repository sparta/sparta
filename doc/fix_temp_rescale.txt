fix temp/rescale command :h3
fix temp/rescale/kk command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID temp/rescale N Tstart Tstop :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
temp/rescale = style name of this fix command
N = thermostat every N timesteps
Tstart,Tstop = desired temperature at start/end of run (temperature units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 temp/rescale 100 300.0 300.0
fix 5 temp/rescale 10 300.0 10.0 :pre

[Description:]

Reset the thermal temperature of all the particles within each grid
cell by explicitly rescaling their thermal velocities.  This is a
simple thermostatting operation to keep the thermal temperature of the
gas near the desired target temperature. This can be useful if an
external driving force is adding energy to the system.  Or if you wish
the thermal temperature of the system to heat or cool over time.

The rescaling is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom
for the particles.  Their rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom
are not altered.

Rescaling is performed every N timesteps. The target temperature is a
ramped value between the Tstart and Tstop temperatures at the
beginning and end of the run.

This fix performs thermostatting on a per grid cell basis.  For each
grid cell, the center-of-mass velocity and thermal temperature of the
particles in the grid cell is computed.  The thermal temperature is
defined as the kinetic temperature after any center-of-mass motion
(e.g. a flow velocity) is subtracted from the collection of particles
in the grid cell.  These are the same calculations as are performed by
the "compute thermal/grid"_compute_thermal_grid.html command.  See its
doc page for the equations.

From the current thermal temperature and the current target
temperature, a velocity scale factor is calculated.  That factor is
applied to each of the components of the thermal velocity for each
particle in the grid cell.

After this rescaling, if the thermal temperature were re-computed for
the grid cell, it would be exactly the target temperature.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix produces no output.

This fix can ramp its target temperature over multiple runs, using the
start and stop keywords of the run command. See the run command for
details of how to do this.

Styles with a {kk} suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
"Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the "Making
SPARTA"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6 when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
