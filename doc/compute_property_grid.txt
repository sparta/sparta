compute property/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID property/grid input1 input2 ... :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
property/grid = style name of this compute command :l
input = one or more grid attributes :l
  possible attributes = id, proc, xlo, ylo, zlo, xhi, yhi, zhi, xc, yc, zc :pre

  id = integer form of grid cell ID
  proc = processor that owns grid cell
  xlo,ylo,zlo = coords of lower left corner of grid cell
  xhi,yhi,zhi = coords of lower left corner of grid cell
  xc,yc,zc = coords of center of grid cell
  vol = flow volume of grid cell (area in 2d) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 all property/grid id xc yc zc :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that simply stores grid attributes for each grid
cell.  This is useful so that the values can be used by other "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 that take computes as inputs.
See for example, the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html, "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_atom.html, and "dump grid"_dump_grid.html commands.

The values are stored in a per-grid vector or array as discussed
below. 

{Id} is the grid cell ID.  In SPARTA each grid cell is assigned a
unique ID which represents its location, in a topological sense,
within the hierarchical grid.  This ID is stored as an integer such as
5774983, but can also be decoded into a string such as 33-4-6, which
makes it easier to understand the grid hierarchy.  In this case it
means the grid cell is at the 3rd level of the hierarchy.  Its
grandparent cell was 33 at the 1st level, its parent was cell 4 (at
level 2) within cell 33, and the cell itself is cell 6 (at level 3)
within cell 4 within cell 33.  If you specify {id}, the ID is printed
directly as an integer.  The ID in string format can be accessed by
the "dump grid"_dump.html command and its {idstr} argument.

{Proc} is the ID of the processor which currently owns the grid cell.

The {xlo}, {ylo}, {zlo} attributes are the coordinates of the
lower-left corner of the grid cell in the appropriate distance
"units"_units.html.  The {xhi}, {yhi}, {zhi} are the coordinates of
the upper-right corner of the grid cell.  The {xc}, {yc}, {zc}
attributes are the coordinates of the center point of the grid cell.
The {zlo}, {zhi}, {zc} attributes cannot be used for a 2d simulation.

The {vol} attribute is the flow volume of the grid cell (or area in
2d).  Flow volume is the portion of the grid cell that is accessible
to particles, i.e. outside any closed surface that may intersect the
cell.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid vector or per-grid array depending
on the number of input values.  If a single input is specified, a
per-grid vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are specified, a
per-grid array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
inputs.

This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See "Section 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
The {id} and {xlo,ylo,zlo} and {xhi,yhi,zhi} values for a split cell
and its sub cells are all the same.  The {vol} of a cut cell is the
portion of the cell in the flow.  The {vol} of a split cell is the
same as if it were unsplit.  The {vol} of each sub cell within a split
cell is its portion of the flow volume.

The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses per-atom
values from a compute as input.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The vector or array values will be in whatever "units"_units.html the
corresponding attribute is in, e.g. distance units for xlo or xc.
