dimension command :h3

[Syntax:]

dimension N :pre

N = 2 or 3 :ul
  
[Examples:]

dimension 2
dimension 3 :pre

[Description:]

Set the dimensionality of the simulation.  By default SPARTA runs 3d
simulations, but 2d simulations can also be run.

2d axi-symmetric models can be run by setting the dimension to 2, and
defining the lower boundary in the y-dimension to axi-symmetric via
the "boundary"_boundary.html command.

[Restrictions:]

This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
"create_box"_create_box.html command.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

dimension 3 :pre
