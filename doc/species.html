<H3>species command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species file ID1 ID2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>file = filename that lists species
<LI>ID1, ID2, ... = one or more species names listed in file
<LI>multi-species abbreviations can also be used (see below) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species species.data air
species species.data air Cl
species species.data O2 N2 NO
species myfile H+ Cl- HCl 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define one or more particle species to use in the simulation.  This
command can be used as many times as desired to add species to the
list of species that the simulation recognizes.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>file</I> is the name of a file containing definitions for
some number of species, not all of which need to used by this
simulation.  Only those requested by ID will be extracted from the
file and they must be present in the file.  The format of the species
file is discussed below.  The data directory in the SPARTA
distribution contains several species files, all with the suffix
".species".
</P>
<P>Each <I>ID</I> is a character string used to identify the species, such as
N or O2 or NO or D or Fe-.  The string can be any combination of
alphanumeric characters, or "=", "-", or underscore.
</P>
<P>Instead of specifying IDs for single species, one of several
pre-defined multi-species names can be used, each of which is expanded
into a list of several individual species IDs.  The list of recognized
abbreviations is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>air = N, O, NO 
</UL>
<P>These abbreviations can be used in combination with single-species IDs
as in the 2nd example above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The format of a species file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines
are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.
All other lines must have the following format with values separated
by whitespace:
</P>
<P>species-ID prop1 prop2 ... prop9
</P>
<P>The species-ID is a string that will be matched against the requested
species-ID, as described above.  The properties are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>prop1 = = molecular weight (atomic mass units, e.g. 16 for oxygen)
<LI>prop2 = = molecular mass (mass units)
<LI>prop3 = rotational degrees of freedom (integer)
<LI>prop4 = rotational ??? ()
<LI>prop5 = vibrational degrees of freedom (integer)
<LI>prop6 = vibrational ??? ()
<LI>prop7 = vibrational temperature (temperature units)
<LI>prop8 = species weight ()
<LI>prop9 = multiple of electon charge (1 for a proton) 
</UL>
<P>TODO: need to fill in ??? and empty units (), also what is species wt?
