<H3>scale_particles command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>scale_particles mix-ID factor 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>mix-ID = ID of mixture to use when scaling particles
<LI>factor = scale factor 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>scale_particles air 0.5
scale_particles air 4.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Scale the number of particles in the simulation by cloning or deleting
individual particles.  This can be useful between runs, or after
reading a restart file, to increase or decrease the particle count
before a new <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command is issued, as if the <A HREF = "global.html">global
fnum</A> value had been changed.  For example, an initial
coarse simulation can be performed, followed by a simulation at
higher resolution.
</P>
<P>Only particles of species in the specified mixture are considered for
cloning/deleting.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how it
defines a collection of species.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>factor</I> can be any value >= 0.0.
</P>
<P>If <I>factor</I> < 1.0, then for each particle, a random number <I>R</I> is
generated.  If R > factor, the particle is deleted.
</P>
<P>If <I>factor</I> > 1.0, then for each particle additional particles may be
created, by cloning all attributes of the original particle, except
for a new random particle ID assigned to each new particle.  E.g. if
<I>factor</I> = 3.4, then two extra particles are created, and a 3rd is
created with probability 0.4.
