fix elecmode command :h3
fix elecmode command/kk :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID elecmode :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
elecmode = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 elecmode :pre

[Description:]

Enable electronic energy states, defined on a per-species
basis, to be used in a simulation.  This fix is meant to be used with
the "collide_modify electronic discrete"_collide_modify.html setting.
This fix allocates per-particle storage for the electronic state.
Collisions between pairs of particles will then transfer energy
between the different electronic states of the two particles.

Internally, this fix defines custom particle attributes named
"elecstate" and "eelec". They are integer and double typed arrays
with a single value for each particle. See the "species"
command for how the electronic states are defined for each 
species.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

However, the values of the custom particle attribute defined by this
fix are written to the restart file. As explained on the
"read_restart"_read_restart.html doc page these values can be
re-assigned to particles when a restart file is read, if a new fix
elecmode command is specified in the restart script before the first
"run"_run.html command is used.

No global or per-particle or per-grid quantities are stored by this
fix for access by various output commands.

However, the custom particle attributes defined by this fix can be
accessed by the "dump particle"_dump.html command, as p_elecstate and p_eelec.
That means those per-particle values can be written to particle dump files.

Styles with a {kk} suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
"Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the "Making
SPARTA"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6 when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This fix is required if "collide_modify electronic discrete" is used.
In this scenario, if it is not defined, an
error will occur when a "create_particles" or "run"_run.html command
is issued.

Defining this fix after particles have been created will not populate
the electronic energy modes of particles that already exist.  An
exception is if the "read_restart"_read_restart.html command is used
to read in particles from a previous simulation where this fix was
used.  In that case, defining this fix after reading the restart file
will enable the particles to keep their previous electronic energy
mode values.
