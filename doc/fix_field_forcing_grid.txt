fix field/forcing/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID field/forcing/grid epsilon Nkspace k1x k1y k1z k2x k2y k2z ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
field/forcing/grid = style name of this fix command
epsilon = param for forcing field (units?)
Nkspace = # of Kspace vectors contributing to forcing field
k1x,k1y,k1z = 3 components of 1st Kspace vector
k2x,k2y,k2z = 3 components of 2nd Kspace vector, etc :ul

[Examples:]

fix stoch field/forcing/grid 1.0 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 :pre

[Description:]

RYAN: Needs an appropriate technical description and basic eqs.


Each timestep when a particle is advected the acceleration vector (a)
for the grid cell it is in acts as a perturbation on straight-line
motion which affects both the end-of-timestep position (x) and
velocity (v) vectors of the particle:

xnew = x + dt*v + 0.5*a*dt^2
vnew = v + dt*a :pre

:line

Note that the "global field"_global.html command provides three
alternatives for specifying an external field:

global field constant ...     # field is constant in space and time
global field particle ...     # field is applied on a per particle basis
global field grid ...         # field is applied on a per grid cell basis :pre

This fix is only used for per-grid fields. 

Note that use of the "global field grid"_global.html command with this
fix will update the field as often as requested.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix stores a per-grid cell array of values which can be accessed
by various output commands on any timestep, e.g. by the "dump
grid"_dump.html command.  The values are those produced by evaluating
the grid-style variables.  The number of rows in the array is the
number of grid cells this processor owns.  The number of columns in
the array is the number of non-NULL variables specified.

[Restrictions:] none
