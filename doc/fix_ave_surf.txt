fix ave/surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID ave/surf Nevery Nrepeat Nfreq value1 value2 ... keyword args ... :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
ave/surf = style name of this fix command :l
Nevery = use input values every this many timesteps :l
Nrepeat = # of times to use input values for calculating averages :l
Nfreq = calculate averages every this many timesteps
zero or more input values can be listed :l
value = c_ID, c_ID\[i\], f_ID, f_ID\[i\], v_name :l
  c_ID = per-surf vector (or array) calculated by a compute with ID
  c_ID\[I\] = Ith column of per-surf array calculated by a compute with ID
  f_ID = per-surf vector (or array) calculated by a fix with ID
  f_ID\[I\] = Ith column of per-surf array calculated by a fix with ID
  v_name = per-surf vector calculated by a surf-style variable with name :pre
zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {ave}
  {ave} args = one or running
    one = output a new average value every Nfreq steps
    running = accumulate average continuously :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all ave/surf 1 100 100 standard ave running
fix 1 all ave/surf 10 20 1000 c_mine :pre

[Description:]

Use one or more per-surf vectors as inputs every few timesteps, and
average them surface element by surface element by over longer
timescales.  The resulting per-surf averages can be used by other
output commands such as the "dump surf"_dump.html command.

Each input value can be a standard surface element attribute or can be
the result of a "compute"_compute.html or "fix"_fix.html or the
evaluation of a surf-style "variable"_variable.html.  In the latter
cases, the compute, fix, or variable must produce a per-surf vector,
not a global quantity or per-molecule quantity.  If you wish to
time-average global quantities from a compute, fix, or variable, then
see the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.

"Computes"_compute.html that produce per-surf vectors or arrays are
those which have the word {surf} in their style name.  See the doc
pages for individual "fixes"_fix.html to determine which ones produce
per-surf vectors or arrays.  "Variables"_variable.html of style {surf}
are the only ones that can be used with this fix since they produce
per-surf vectors.

Each per-surf value of each input vector is averaged independently.

:line

The {Nevery}, {Nrepeat}, and {Nfreq} arguments specify on what
timesteps the input values will be used in order to contribute to the
average.  The final averaged quantities are generated on timesteps
that are a multiple of {Nfreq}.  The average is over {Nrepeat}
quantities, computed in the preceding portion of the simulation every
{Nevery} timesteps.  {Nfreq} must be a multiple of {Nevery} and
{Nevery} must be non-zero even if {Nrepeat} is 1.  Also, the timesteps
contributing to the average value cannot overlap, i.e. Nfreq >
(Nrepeat-1)*Nevery is required.

For example, if Nevery=2, Nrepeat=6, and Nfreq=100, then values on
timesteps 90,92,94,96,98,100 will be used to compute the final average
on timestep 100.  Similarly for timesteps 190,192,194,196,198,200 on
timestep 200, etc.

If a value begins with "c_", a compute ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, the per-grid vector calculated by the compute is used.  If a
bracketed term containing an index I is appended, the Ith column of
the per-grid array calculated by the compute is used.  Users can also
write code for their own compute styles and "add them to
SPARTA"_Section_modify.html.

If a value begins with "f_", a fix ID must follow which has been
previously defined in the input script.  If no bracketed term is
appended, the per-grid vector calculated by the fix is used.  If a
bracketed term containing an index I is appended, the Ith column of
the per-grid array calculated by the fix is used.  Note that some
fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps, which must be
compatible with {Nevery}, else an error will result.  Users can also
write code for their own fix styles and "add them to
SPARTA"_Section_modify.html.

If a value begins with "v_", a variable name must follow which has
been previously defined in the input script as a "grid-style
variable"_variable.html Variables of style {grid} can reference
thermodynamic keywords, or invoke other computes, fixes, or variables
when they are evaluated, so this is a very general means of generating
per-grid quantities to time average.

NOTE: say something about how compute, fix, variable quantities
are normalized for output.

Additional optional keywords also affect the operation of this fix. 

The {ave} keyword determines what happens to the accumulation of
statistics every {Nfreq} timesteps.

If the {ave} setting is {one}, then the values produced on timesteps
that are multiples of Nfreq are independent of each other.  Normalization
(as described above) is performed, and all tallies are zeroed before
accumulating over the next {Nfreq} steps.

If the {ave} setting is {running}, then tallies are never zeroed.
Thus the output at any {Nfreq} timestep is normalized over all
previously accumulated samples since the fix was defined.  The tallies
can only be zeroed by deleting the fix via the unfix command, or by
re-defining the fix, or by re-specifying it.

[Restart, fix_modify, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix produces a per-surf vector or array which can be accessed by
various output commands.  A vector is produced if only a single
quantity is averaged by this fix.  If two or more quantities are
averaged, then an array of values is produced, where the number of
columns is the number of quantities averaged.  The per-surf values can
only be accessed on timesteps that are multiples of {Nfreq} since that
is when averaging is performed.

[Restrictions:] none
