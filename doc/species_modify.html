<H3>species_modify command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species_modify ID property value ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, property, value can be repeated one or more times 

<LI>ID = species ID 

<LI>property = <I>mu</I> 

<PRE>  mu = magnetic moment 
</PRE>
<LI>value = value of property for that species 

<PRE>  value for <I>mu</I> is in magnetic moment units 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>species_modify Fe mu 2.0 Cr mu 3.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set additional properties of one or more species used in a simulation.
This can be used as many times as desired for different species and
properties.  Currently it only supports setting of a single optional
property (the magnetic moment) which is not included in the species
files read in by the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each <I>ID</I> is a character string used to identify a species, such as N
or O2 or NO or D or Fe-.  See the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command for
how species are added to a simulation model by reading their
properties from a species file.
</P>
<P>The only property currently recognized is <I>mu</I> or the scalar magnetic
moment of each particle of the species.  The <I>value</I> for the <I>mu</I>
property should be specified in the units described on the
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> doc page.
