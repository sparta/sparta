remove_surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

remove_surf surfID :pre

surfID = group ID for which surface elements to remove :ul

[Examples:]

remove_surf topsurf :pre

[Description:]

Remove a group of surface elements that have previously been read-in
via the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  The "group
surf"_group.html or "read_surf"_read_surf.html can be used to assign
each surface element to one or more groups.  This command removes all
surface elements in the specified {surfID} group.

Note that the remaining surface elements must still constitute a
"watertight" surface or an error will be generated.  The definition of
watertight is explained in the Restrictions section of the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html doc page.

After surface elements have been deleted the IDs of the remaining
surface points and elements are renumbered so that the remaining N
elements have IDs from 1 to N.  The new list of surface elements can
be output via the "write_surf"_write_surf.html or "dump
surf"_dump.html commands.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]
