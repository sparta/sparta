surf_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_modify group-ID keyword args ... :pre
group-ID = ID of the surface group to operate on :l
one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {collide} or (react) :l
  {collide} arg = sc-ID
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model
  {react} arg = sr-ID
    sr-ID = ID of a surface reaction model or {none} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_modify sphere collide 1
surf_modify all collide sphere react sphere :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for a group of surface elements in the specified
group-ID.  Surface elements are read in by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  They can be assigned to groups by
that command or via the "group"_group.html command.

The {collide} keyword is used to assign a surface collision model.
Surface collision models are defined by the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command, which assigns each a surface
collision ID, specified here as {sc-ID}.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with surface
elements in group-ID will be computed by the surface collision model
with {sc-ID}.

The {react} keyword is used to assign a surface reaction model.
Surface reaction models are defined by the
"surf_react"_surf_react.html command, which assigns each a surface
reaction ID, specified here as {sr-ID} or the word "none".  The latter
means no reaction model.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with surface
elements in group-ID will induce reactions which are computed by the
surface reaction model with {sr-ID}.  If "none" is used, no surface
reactions occur.

Note that if the same surface element is assigned to multiple groups,
using this command multiple times may override the effect of a
previous command that assigned a different collision or reaction model
to a particular surface element.

[Restrictions:]

All surface elements must be assigned to a surface collision model via
the {collide} keyword before a simlulation can be performed.  Using a
surface reaction model is optional.

This command cannot be used before surfaces exist.

[Related commands:]

"read_surf"_read_surf.html, "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html

[Default:]

The default for surface reactions is none.
