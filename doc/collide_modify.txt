collide_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

collide_modify keyword values ...  :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keywords = {vremax} or {remain} :l
  {vremax} values = Nevery startflag
    Nevery = zero vremax every this many timesteps
    startflag = {yes} or {no} = zero vremax at start of every run
  {remain} value = {yes} or {no} = hold remaining fraction of collisions over to next timestep :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

collide_modify vremax 1000 yes
collide_modify vremax 0 no remain no :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters that affect how collisions are performed.

The {vremax} keyword affects how often the Vremax parameter for
collision frequency is re-zeroed during the simulation.  The value of
Vremax affects how many events are attempted in each grid cell, and
thus the overall time spent performing collisions.  As its name
implies Vremax is continuously set to the largest difference in
velocity between a pair of colliding particles (in each grid cell).
The larger Vremax grows, the more collisions are attempted for the
grid cell on each timestep, though this does not affect the number of
collisions actually performed.  Thus if Vremax grows large, collisions
become less efficient, though still accurate.

For non-equilibrium flows, it is typically desirable to reset Vremax
to zero fairly frequently (e.g. every 1000 steps) so that it does not
become large, due to anomolously fast moving particles.  In contrast,
when a system is at equilibrium, it is typically desirable to not
reset Vremax to zero since it will also stay roughly constant.

If {Nevery} is specified as 0, Vremax is not zeroed during a run.
Otherwise Vremax is zeroed on timesteps that are a multiple of
{Nevery}.  Additionally, if {startflag} is set to {yes}, Vremax is
zeroed at the start of every run.  If it is set to {no}, it is not.

The {remain} keyword affects how the number of attempted collisions
for each grid cell is calculated each timestep.  If the value is set
to {yes}, then any fractional collision count (for each grid cell) is
carried over to the next timestep.  E.g. if the computed collision
count is 7.3, then 7 attempts are made on this timestep, and 0.3 are
carried over to the next timestep, to be added to the computed
collision count for that step.  If the value is set to {no}, then no
carry-over is made.  Instead, in this example, 7 attempts are made and
an 8th attempt is made conditionally with a probability of 0.3, using
a randomly generated number.
