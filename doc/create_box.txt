create_box command :h3

[Syntax:]

create_box xlo xhi ylo yhi zlo zhi :pre

xlo,xhi = box bounds in the x dimension (distance units)
ylo,yhi = box bounds in the y dimension (distance units)
zlo,zhi = box bounds in the z dimension (distance units) :pre

[Examples:]

create_box 0 1 0 1 0 1
create_box 0 1 0 1 -0.5 0.5
create_box 0 10.0 0 5.0 -4.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set the size of the simulation box.

For a 2d simulation, as specifed by the "dimension"_dimension.html
command, {zlo} < 0.0 and {zhi} > 0.0 is required.  This means the z
dimensions straddle 0.0.  Typical values are -0.5 and 0.5, but this is
not required.  See "Section 6.1"_Section_howto.html#howto_1 of the
manual for more information about 2d simulations.

For 2d axisymmetric simulations, as set by the
"dimension"_dimension.html and "boundary"_boundary.html commands, the
ylo setting must be 0.0.  See "Section 6.2"_Section_howto.html#howto_2
of the manual for more information about axisymmetric simulations.
