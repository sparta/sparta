compute ke/particle command :h3
compute ke/particle/kk command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID ke/particle :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ke/particle = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 ke/particle :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom translational
kinetic energy for each particle.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump particle"_dump.html command.

The kinetic energy is

Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = 1/2 m Vsq :pre

where m is the mass and (Vx,Vy,Vz) are the velocity components of the
particle.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.

The vector can be accessed by any command that uses per-particle
values from a compute as input.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The per-particle vector values will be in energy "units"_units.html.

Styles with a {kk} suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
"Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the "Making
SPARTA"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_6 when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See the "Accelerating SPARTA"_Section_accelerate.html section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
