units command :h3

[Syntax:]

units style :pre

style = {cgs} or {si} :ul

[Examples:]

units cgs :pre

[Description:]

This command sets the style of units used for a simulation.  It
determines the units of all quantities specified in the input script
and various input files read by SPARTA, as well as the units of all
quantities output to the screen, log file, dump files, and other
output files.  Typically, this command is used at the very beginning
of an input script.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Internally, this command simply sets the numeric
values of conversion factors used by SPARTA, e.g. the Boltzmann
constant used to convert temperature to energy.  It is up to you to
insure that all input values used in the input script and other input
files (surface data, species files, reaction files) contain numeric
values consistent with the chosen units.

For style {cgs}, these are the units:

mass = grams
distance = centimeters
area = cm^2
volume = cm^3
time = seconds
energy = ergs
velocity = centimeters/second
acceleration = centimeters/second^2
pressure = barye (dyne/cm^2 = 0.1 pascals)
magnetic moment = ??
temperature = degrees K :ul

For style {si}, these are the units:

mass = kilograms
distance = meters
area = m^2
volume = m^3
time = seconds
energy = Joules
velocity = meters/second
acceleration = meters/second^2
pressure = pascals (newton/meter^2)
magnetic moment = ??
temperature = degrees K :ul

The units command also sets a default timestep size; see the
"timestep"_timestep.html command to change this value.

For style {cgs} this is dt = 1.0 sec.
For style {si} this is dt = 1.0 sec. :ul

[Restrictions:]

This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
"create_box"_create_box.html command.
