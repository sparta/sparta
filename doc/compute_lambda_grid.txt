compute lambda/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID lambda/grid nrho temp species extra :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
lambda/grid = style name of this compute command :l
nrho = compute or fix column for number density, prefaced by "c_" or "f_" :l
temp = NULL or compute or fix column for temperature, prefaced by "c_" or "f_" :l
species = species name used for reference properties :l
extra = {kall} or {kx} or {ky} or {kz} (optional) :l
  {kall} = also calculate Knudsen number based on cell size in all dimensions
  {kx} = also calculate Knudsen number based on cell size in x dimension
  {ky} = also calculate Knudsen number based on cell size in y dimension
  {kz} = also calculate Knudsen number based on cell size in z dimension :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 lambda/grid c_GR\[1\] NULL Ar
compute 1 lambda/grid f_ave\[2\] f_ave\[3\] N2 kall :pre

These commands will dump time averages for the mean free path for each
grid cell to a dump file every 1000 steps:

compute 1 grid species nrho temp
fix 1 ave/grid 10 100 1000 c_1
compute 2 lambda/grid f_1\[1\] f_1\[2\] Ar
dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.grid id c_2 :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the mean free path (lambda)
between molecular collisions for each grid cell, based on the
particles in the cell.  It has an option to also compute the Knudsen
number for each cell which is the mean free path divided by the cell
size.  These quantities can be useful for estimating the optimal grid
cell size and using it to adapt the grid, e.g. via the
"adapt_grid"_adapt_grid.html or "fix adapt/grid"_fix_adapt_grid.html
commands.

Unlike other computes that calculate per grid cell values, this
compute does not take a "mixture"_mixture.html ID as an argument.
This is because it uses the number density and temperature calculated
by another compute or fix as input, and that compute or fix uses a
"mixture"_mixture.html ID as its own argument.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  For example, the values can be output by the
"dump grid"_dump.html command.

The formula used to calculate the mean free path (lambda) is given in
"(Bird94)"_#Bird94 as equation 4.65:

:c,image(Eqs/lambda.jpg)

This is an approximate mean free path for a multi-species mixture,
suitable for estimating optimal grid cell sizes as explained above.
It is a simplied version of formulas 4.76 and 4.77 from the same
reference.

Dref and Tref and omega are collision properties for a reference
species in the flow.  The reference species is specified by the
{species} argument.  It must be a species defined by the
"species"_species.html command and listed in the file of per-species
collision properties read in by the "collide"_collide.html command.

Specifically, Dref is the diameter of molecules of the species, Tref
is the reference temperature, and omega is its viscosity
temperature-dependence.

In the formula above, {n} is the number density and {T} is the thermal
temperature of particles in a grid cell.  This compute does not
calculate these quantities itself; instead it uses another compute or
fix to perform the calculation.  This is done by specifying the {nrho}
and {temp} arguments as either

c_ID\[m\] = compute with ID that calculates nrho/temp as its Mth column of output
f_ID\[m\] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged nrho/temp as its Mth column of output :ul

The {temp} argument can also be specified as NULL, which drops the
(Tref/T) ratio term from the formula above.  That is also the case if
the reference species defines omega = 1/2.  In that case, the {temp}
argument is ignored, whether it is NULL or not.

Note that if the value of {n} is 0.0 for a grid cell, its
mean-free-path will be set to 1.0e20 (infinite length).

The "compute_grid"_compute_grid.html command can calculate a number
density, using its {nrho} value.  It can also calculate a temperature
using its {temp} value.  Note that this temperature is inferred from
the translational kinetic energy of the particles, which is only
appopriate for the mean free path calculation for systems with zero or
small streaming velocities.  For systems with streaming flow, the
temperature can be calculated by the {thermal} keyword of the "compute
sonine/grid"_compute_sonine_grid.html command.  The formulas on its
doc page show that the the center-of-mass velocity from the particles
is subtracted, leaving their translational thermal velocity, from
which a thermal temperature is inferred.

The "fix ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command can calculate the same
values in a time-averaged sense, assuming it uses these same computes
as its input.  Using this fix as input to this compute will thus yield
less noisy values, due to the time averaging.

Note that the compute or fix (via the compute(s) it uses as input) can
perform its number density or temperature calculation for a subset of
the particles based on the "mixture" it uses.  See the
"mixture"_mixture.html command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If the ID of a "fix ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html
command is used as the {nrho} or {temp} argument, it only produces
output on timesteps that are multiples of its {Nfreq} argument.  Thus
this compute can only be invoked on those timesteps.  For example, if
a "dump grid"_dump.html command invokes this compute to write values
to a dump file, it must do so on timesteps that are multiples of
{Nfreq}.

One of the {kall} or {kx} or {ky} or {kz} extra arguments can be
optionally appended.  If specified, this calculates an additional
value per grid cell, namely the dimensionless Knudsen number which is
the ratio of the mean free path to the cell size.  For {kall}, the
cell size is taken to be the average of the three grid cell side
lengths (or two cell lengths for a 2d simulation).  For {kx}, {ky}, or
{kz}, the cell size is the single cell side length in the
corresponding x,y,z dimension.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid vector or array.  If one of {kall},
{kx}, {ky}, or {kz} is not specified, then it is a vector.  If one
extra argument is specified, it is an array with two columns.  The
vector or first column of the array is the mean free path; the second
column is the Knudsen number.

This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See "Section 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that split cells and unsplit cells inside closed surfaces contain
no particles.  Thus they will compute a zero result for all the
individual values.

The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid
values from a compute as input.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The per-grid array values for the vector or first column of the array
will be in distance "units"_units.html.  The second column of the
array will be dimensionless.

[Restrictions:]

To use this compute, a collision style must be defined via the
"collide"_collide.html command, which defines properties for the
reference {species}.

As explained above, to use this compute with {nrho} or {temp} defined
as input from a "fix ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command, this compute
must only be invoked on timesteps that are multiples of the {Nfreq}
argument used by the fix, since those are the steps when it produces
output.
