<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID surf/collision/tally group-ID mix-ID value1 value2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID is documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command 

<LI>surf/collision/tally = style name of this compute command 

<LI>group-ID = group ID for which surface elements to perform calculation on 

<LI>mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on 

<LI>one or more values can be appended 

<LI>value = <I>id/surf</I> or <I>id</I> or <I>type</I> or <I>time</I> or <I>xc</I> or <I>yc</I> or <I>zc</I> or <I>vx/pre</I> or <I>vy/pre</I> or <I>vz/pre</I> or <I>vx/post</I> or <I>vy/post</I> or <I>vz/post</I> 

<PRE>  <I>id/surf</I> = surface element ID
  <I>id</I> = particle ID
  <I>type</I> = particle species
  <I>time</I> = time of collision (within timestep, see below)
  <I>xc</I>, <I>yc</I>, <I>zc</I> = coordinates of collision point
  <I>vx/pre</I>, <I>vy/pre</I>, <I>vz/pre</I> = velocity components before collision
  <I>vx/post</I>, <I>vy/post</I>, <I>vz/post</I> = velocity components after collision

<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>compute 1 surf/collision/tally all all id id/surf time xc yc zc

<P>This command will dump the tallies in the previous command to a dump
file every 10 steps:
</P>
<PRE>dump 1 tally all 10 tmp.tally c_1[*] 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Tally various values for each collision of a particle with a surface
element during the current timestep.  Only surface collisions which do
not result in chemical reactions are tallied by this command.  See the
related <A HREF = "compute_reaction_tally.html">compute surf/reaction/tally</A>
command to tally reactions.  It provides different tally values than
this compute.
</P>
<P>Only surface elements in the surface group specified by <I>group-ID</I> and
particles with species in the mixture specified by <I>mix-ID</I> are
included.  See the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A> command for info on how
surface elements can be assigned to surface groups.
</P>
<P>This compute can be used for simulations with either explicit or
implicit surface elements.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto_13">Section 6.13</A> for
more discussion of explicit and implicit surfaces.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump tally</A> command.  Currently this is the only option for
accessing the tallied values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>id/surf</I> value is the ID of the surface element.  For explicit
surfaces, surface element IDs are unique.  For implicit surfaces, the
surface ID of all the surface elements within a grid cell are the grid
cell ID.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto_13">Section 6.13</A> for more discussion of
explicit and implicit surfaces.
</P>
<P>The <I>id</I> value is the ID of the particle.  Note that particle IDs are
generated randomly.  Thus multiple particles in the system can
potentially have the same ID.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for
more details on particle IDs.
</P>
<P>The <I>type</I> value is an integer index for the particle species.  It is
a value from 1 to Nspecies. The value corresponds to the order in
which species were defined via the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more details on particle
types.
</P>
<P>The <I>time</I> value is the point in time within the timestep when the
collision occured.  Thus if the timestep size is DT, as set by the
<A HREF = "timestep.html">timestep</A> command, the <I>time</I> values will all be within
the range of 0.0 to DT, for all collisions tallied by this compute on
each timestep it is invoked.
</P>
<P>The <I>xc</I>, <I>yc</I>, and <I>zc</I> are the coordinates of the collision point
between the particle and the surface element.
</P>
<P>The <I>vx/pre</I>, <I>vy/pre</I>, <I>vz/pre</I> values are the velocity components of
the incident particle before it collides with the surface element.
</P>
<P>The <I>vx/post</I>, <I>vy/post</I>, <I>vz/post</I> values are the velocity components
of the particle after it collides with the surface element.
</P>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-tally array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-tally values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 6.4</A>
for an overview of SPARTA output options.
</P>
<P>The per-tally array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  <I>Time</I> is in
time units; see above for details.  <I>Xc</I>, <I>yc</I>, and <I>zc</I> are in
distance units.  <I>Vx/pre</I>, <I>vy/pre</I>, <I>vz/pre</I> are in velocity units, as
are <I>vx/post</I>, <I>vy/post</I>, <I>vz/post</I>.
