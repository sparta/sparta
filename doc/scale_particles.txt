scale_particles command :h3

[Syntax:]

scale_particles mix-ID factor :pre

mix-ID = ID of mixture to use when scaling particles
factor = scale factor :ul

[Examples:]

scale_particles air 0.5
scale_particles air 4.0 :pre

[Description:]

Scale the number of particles in the simulation by cloning or deleting
individual particles.  This can be useful between runs, or after
reading a restart file, to increase or decrease the particle count
before a new "run"_run.html command is issued, as if the "global
fnum"_global.html value had been changed.  For example, an initial
coarse simulation can be performed, followed by a simulation at
higher resolution.

Only particles of species in the specified mixture are considered for
cloning/deleting.  See the "mixture"_mixture.html command for how it
defines a collection of species.

The specified {factor} can be any value >= 0.0.

If {factor} < 1.0, then for each particle, a random number {R} is
generated.  If R > factor, the particle is deleted.

If {factor} > 1.0, then for each particle additional particles may be
created, by cloning all attributes of the original particle, except
for a new random particle ID assigned to each new particle.  E.g. if
{factor} = 3.4, then two extra particles are created, and a 3rd is
created with probability 0.4.
