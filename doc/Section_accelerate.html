<H3>5. Accelerating SPARTA performance 
</H3>
<P>This section describes various methods for improving SPARTA
performance for different classes of problems running on different
kinds of machines.
</P>
<P>Currently the only option is to use the KOKKOS accelerator
packages provided with SPARTA that
contains code optimized for certain kinds of hardware, including
multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors.
</P>

</UL>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/bench.html">Benchmark page</A> of the SPARTA
web site gives performance results for the various accelerator
packages discussed in Section 5.2, for several of the standard SPARTA
benchmark problems, as a function of problem size and number of
compute nodes, on different hardware platforms.

<H4><A NAME = "acc_1"></A>5.1 Measuring performance 
</H4>
<P>Before trying to make your simulation run faster, you should
understand how it currently performs and where the bottlenecks are.
</P>
<P>The best way to do this is run the your system (actual number of
particles) for a modest number of timesteps (say 100 steps) on several
different processor counts, including a single processor if possible.
Do this for an equilibrium version of your system, so that the
100-step timings are representative of a much longer run.  There is
typically no need to run for 1000s of timesteps to get accurate
timings; you can simply extrapolate from short runs.
</P>
<P>For the set of runs, look at the timing data printed to the screen and
log file at the end of each SPARTA run.  <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_7">This
section</A> of the manual has an overview.
</P>
<P>Running on one (or a few processors) should give a good estimate of
the serial performance and what portions of the timestep are taking
the most time.  Running the same problem on a few different processor
counts should give an estimate of parallel scalability.  I.e. if the
simulation runs 16x faster on 16 processors, its 100% parallel
efficient; if it runs 8x faster on 16 processors, it's 50% efficient.
</P>
<P>The most important data to look at in the timing info is the timing
breakdown and relative percentages.  For example, trying different
options for speeding up the FFTs will have little impact
if they only consume 10% of the run time.  If the collide time is
dominating, you may want to look at the KOKKOS package, as discussed
below.  Comparing how the percentages change as
you increase the processor count gives you a sense of how different
operations within the timestep are scaling.
</P>
<P>Another important detail in the timing info are the histograms of
particles counts and neighbor counts.  If these vary widely across
processors, you have a load-imbalance issue.  This often results in
inaccurate relative timing data, because processors have to wait when
communication occurs for other processors to catch up.  Thus the
reported times for "Communication" or "Other" may be higher than they
really are, due to load-imbalance.  If this is an issue, you can
uncomment the MPI_Barrier() lines in src/timer.cpp, and recompile
SPARTA, to obtain synchronized timings.

<H4><A NAME = "acc_3"></A>5.3 Packages with optimized styles 
</H4>
<P>Accelerated versions of various <A HREF = "collide_style.html">collide_style</A>,
<A HREF = "fix.html">fixes</A>, <A HREF = "compute.html">computes</A>, and other commands have
been added to SPARTA via the KOKKOS package, which may run faster than the
standard non-accelerated versions.
</P>
<P>All of these commands are in the KOKKOS package provided with SPARTA.  An
overview of packages is give in <A HREF = "Section_packages.html">Section
packages</A>.
</P>
<P>SPARTA currently has acceleration support for
three kinds of hardware, via the KOKKOS package: Many-core CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and
Intel Xeon Phi.
</P>
<P>Whether you will see speedup for your hardware may depend on the size
problem you are running and what commands (accelerated and
non-accelerated) are invoked by your input script.  While these doc
pages include performance guidelines, there is no substitute for
trying out the KOKKOS package.
</P>
<P>Any accelerated style has the same name as the corresponding standard
style, except that a suffix is appended.  Otherwise, the syntax for
the command that uses the style is identical, their functionality is
the same, and the numerical results it produces should also be the
same, except for precision and round-off effects, and differences in random
numbers.
</P>
<P>For example, the KOKKOS package provides an accelerated variant of the
Temperature Compute <A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute temp</A>, namely <A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute
temp/kk</A>
</P>
<P>To see what accelerate styles are currently available, see
<A HREF = "Section_commands.html#cmd_5">Section 3.5</A> of the manual.  The
doc pages for individual commands (e.g. <A HREF = "compute_temp.html">compute temp</A>)
also list any accelerated variants available
for that style.
</P>
<P>To use an accelerator package in SPARTA, and one or more of the styles
it provides, follow these general steps:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >install the accelerator package </TD><TD >  make yes-fft, make yes-kokkos, etc </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >add compile/link flags to Makefile.machine in src/MAKE </TD><TD >  KOKKOS_ARCH=Pascal60 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >re-build SPARTA </TD><TD >  make kokkos_cuda </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >prepare and test a regular SPARTA simulation </TD><TD >  lmp_kokkos_cuda -in in.script; mpirun -np 32 lmp_kokkos_cuda -in in.script </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >enable specific accelerator support via '-k on' <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">command-line switch</A>, </TD><TD >  -k on g 1 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >set any needed options for the package via "-pk" <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">command-line switch</A> or <A HREF = "package.html">package</A> command, </TD><TD >  only if defaults need to be changed, -pk kokkos reduction atomic </TD></TR>
<TR><TD >use accelerated styles in your input via "-sf" <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">command-line switch</A> or <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command </TD><TD > lmp_kokkos_cuda -in in.script -sf kk
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Note that the first 3 steps can be done as a single command with
suitable make command invocations. This is discussed in <A HREF = "Section_packages.html">Section
4</A> of the manual, and its use is
illustrated in the individual accelerator sections.  Typically these
steps only need to be done once, to create an executable that uses one
or more accelerator packages.
</P>
<P>The last 4 steps can all be done from the command-line when SPARTA is
launched, without changing your input script, as illustrated in the
individual accelerator sections.  Or you can add
<A HREF = "package.html">package</A> and <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> commands to your input
script.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov/bench.html">Benchmark
page</A> of the SPARTA web site gives
performance results for the various accelerator packages for several
of the standard SPARTA benchmark problems, as a function of problem
size and number of compute nodes, on different hardware platforms.
</P>
<P>Here is a brief summary of what the KOKKOS package provides.
</P>
<LI>Styles with a "kk" suffix are part of the KOKKOS package, and can be
run using OpenMP on multicore CPUs, on an NVIDIA GPU, or on an Intel
Xeon Phi in "native" mode.  The speed-up depends on a variety of
factors, as discussed on the KOKKOS accelerator page.
