compute tvib/grid command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID tvib/grid mix-ID :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
grid = style name of this compute command
mix-ID = mixture ID to perform calculation on :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 tvib/grid species

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the vibrational temperature for
each grid cell, based on the particles in the cell.  The temperature
is calculated separately for each group of species in the specified
mixture, as described in the Output section below.  See the mixture
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump grid"_dump.html command.

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the "fix
ave/grid"_fix_ave_grid.html command.  It does its averaging as if the
particles in the cell at each sampling timestep were combined together
into one large set to compute the formulas below.  Note that this is a
different normalization than taking the values produced by the
formulas below for a single timestep, summing them over the sampling
timesteps, and then dividing by the number of sampling steps.

The vibrational temperature for a group of particles comprised of
different species is defined as a weighted average as follows:

T_group = (T1*N1 + T2*N2 + ...) / (N1 + N2 + ...) :pre

The sums in the numerator and denominator are over the different
species in the group.  T1, T2, ... are the vibrational temperatures of
each species.  N1, N2, ... are the counts of particles of each
species.

The vibrational temperature Tsp for particles of a single species in
the group is defined as follows

Tsp = (2/kB) Sum_i (evib_i) / N (2 Ibar ln(1 + 1/Ibar))
Ibar = Sum_i (e_vib_i) / (N kB Theta) :pre

where e_vib is the vibrational energy of a single particle I, N is the
total # of particles of that species, and {kB} is the Boltzmann factor.
Theta is the characteristic vibrational temperature for the species,
as defined in the file read by the "species"_species.html command.

Note that the "collide_modify vibrate"_collide_modify.html command
affects how vibrational energy is treated in particle collisions and
stored by particles.  It thus also affects the vibrational temperature
calculated by this compute.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of groups in the specified mixture.

This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See "Section 4.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  Thus they
will compute a zero result for all the individual values.

The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See "Section 4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4
for an overview of SPARTA output options.

The per-grid array values will be in temperature "units"_units.html.
