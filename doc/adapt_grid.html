<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command perform a one-time adaptation of grid cells, either by
refinement or coarsening or both.  This command can be invoked as many
times as desired, before or between simulation runs.  Grid adaptation
can also be performed on-the-fly during a simulation by using the <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix
adapt</A> command.
</P>
<P>Refinement means splitting one child cell into multiple new child
cells; the original child cell becomes a parent cell.  Coarsening
means combining all the child cells of a parent cell into a single new
child cell.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section howto 4.8</A> for a
description of the hierarchical grid used by SPARTA and a defintion of
child and parent cells.
</P>
<P>Grid adaptation can be useful for adjusting the grid cell sizes to the
current density distribution or mean-free-path of particles or to
other simulation attributes such as the presence of surface elements.
A well-adapted grid can improve accuracy of the simulation and reduce
its computational cost.
</P>
<P>The <I>action1</I> and <I>action2</I> parameters determine whether refinement or
coarsening is performed and in what order.  <I>Action2</I> is optional.  If
not specified, only <I>action1</I> is performed.  Note that cells that are
refined by <I>action1</I> are not eligible for subsequent coarsening by
<I>action2</I>.  Likewise cells that are coarsened by <I>action1</I> are not
eligible for subsequent refinement by <I>action2</I>.  This is also true if
the <I>iterate</I> keyword is used to loop over the two actions multiple
times.  Cells can be successivly refined on each iteration, but will
never be coarsened.  Likewise cells can be successivly coarsensed, but
will never be refined.  Of course they may be refined or coarsened
later if the adapt_grid command is used again.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Need some pics of adapted grids, for both refinment and
coarsening.
</P>
<P>The first step in a refinement action is to determine what child cells
are eligible for refinement.  Child cells that are wholly inside a
closed surface are not eligible.  The <I>maxlevel</I> and <I>region</I> keywords
also affect elibilitity.  They are described below.
</P>
<P>The first step in a coarsening action is to determine what parent
cells are eligible for coarsening.  Only parent cells with all of
their children as child cells are eligible.  If one or more of their
children are also parent cells, then the parent cell is a
"grandparent" and is not eligible for coarsening.  The <I>minlevel</I> and
<I>region</I> keywords also affect elibilitity.  They are described below.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> parameter is then used to decide whether to refine or
coarsen each eligible grid cell.  The operation of the differnt styles
is described in the next section.  Note that for refinement, the
number of new child cells created withing a single cell is set by the
<I>cells</I> keyword which defaults to 2x2x2 for 3d models and 2x2x1 for 2d
models.
</P>
<P>Note that many of the style take an argument for both refinement and
coarsening, e.g. <I>rcount</I> and <I>ccount</I> for style <I>particle</I>.  Both
arguments must be specified, though one or the other will be ignored
if the specified actions do not include refinement or coarsening.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>particle</I> style adapts based on the number of particles in a grid
cell.  For refinement, if the current number (on this timestep) is
more than <I>rcount</I>, the cell is refined.  For coarsening, if the sum
of the current number of particles in all child cells of the parent
cell is less than <I>ccount</I>, the parent cell is coarsened.  Note that
if you wish to use time-averaged counts of particles in each cell you
should use the <I>value</I> style with the ID of a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command that time-averages particle counts
from the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>surf</I> style adapts only if a grid cell contains one or more
surface elements in the specified <I>surfID</I> group.  The <I>dir</I> keyword
can be used to exclude additional surface elements.  For refinement,
the cell is refined unless the refinement will create child cells with
any of their dimensions smaller than the specified <I>ssize</I>.  For
coarsening, the parent cell is coarsend only if any of the child cell
dimensions is smaller than the specified <I>ssize</I>.
</P>
<P>The <I>value</I> style uses values calculated by a <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A>
or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> to decide whether to adapt each cell.  The fix or
compute must calculate per-grid values as described in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section howto
4.4</A>.  If the compute or fix calculates a
vector of such values, it is specified as c_ID or f_ID.  If it
calculates an array of such values, it is specified as c_ID[N] or
f_ID[N] when N is the column of value to use from 1 to Ncolumns.
</P>
<P>For refinement, if the compute or fix value for the grid cell is
"more" than <I>rvalue</I>, the cell is refined.  For coarsening, if the
"sum" of the compute or fix values in all child cells of the parent
cell is "less" than <I>cvalue</I>, the parent cell is coarsened.  The
<I>thresh</I> keyword can be used to change the refinment or coarsening
criteria to "less" versus "more".  Likewise the <I>combine</I> keyword can
be used to change the "sum" of child cell values to be a "min" or
"max" operation.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Give example of value style for time-averaged particle count
from fix ave/grid.  And for lambda from compute lambda (and also a
time-averaged version of lambda.
</P>
<P>The <I>random</I> style is provided mostly for test and debugging purposes.
For each cell eligible for adaptation, a uniform random number RN
bewteen 0.0 and 1.0 is generated.  For refinement, the cell is refined
if RN < <I>rfrac</I>, so that approximately an <I>rfrac</I> fraction of the
child cells are refined.  Similarly, for coarsening, the parent cell
is coarsened if RN < <I>cfrac</I>, so that approximately a <I>cfrac</I> fraction
of the parent cells are coarsened.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Various optional keyword can also be specified.
</P>
<P>The <I>iterate</I> keyword determines how many times the <I>action1</I> and
<I>action2</I> operations are looped over.  The default is once.  If
multiple iterations are used, cells can be recursively refined or
coarsened.  If no further refinement or coarsening occurs on an
iteration, the loop ends.  Note that the compute used with style
<I>value</I> will be recalculated at each iteration to accurately reflect
per grid values for the current grid.
</P>
<P>The <I>maxlevel</I> keyword limits how far a grid cell can be refined.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section howto 4.8</A> for a definition of the
level assigned to each parent and child cell.  Child cells with a
level >= <I>Nmax</I> are not eligible for refinement.  The default setting
of <I>Nmax</I> = 0 means there is no limit on refinement.
</P>
<P>The <I>minlevel</I> keyword limits how far a grid cell can be coarsened.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section howto 4.8</A> for a definition of
the level assigned to each parent and child cell.  Parent cells with a
level < <I>Nmin</I> are not eligible for coarsening.  The default setting
of <I>Nmax</I> = 1 means the only limit on coarsening is that the first
level grid is preserved (never coarsened to a single root cell).
</P>
<P>The <I>thresh</I> keyword is only used by the style <I>value</I>.  It sets the
comparison criterion for refinement as <I>rdecide</I> = <I>less</I> or <I>more</I>.
This means a child cell is refined if its compute or fix value is
<I>less</I> or <I>more</I> than <I>rvalue</I>.  Similarly, it sets the comparison
criterion for coarsening as <I>cdecide</I> = <I>less</I> or <I>more</I>.  This means
a parent cell is coarsened if the compute or fix value accumulated
from the compute or fix values of its children is <I>less</I> or <I>more</I>
than <I>cvalue</I>.
</P>
<P>The <I>combine</I> keyword is only used by the style <I>value</I>.  It
determines how the compute or fix value for a parent cell is
accumulated from the compute or fix values of all its cheildren.  If
the setting is <I>sum</I>, the child values are summed.  If it is <I>min</I> or
<I>max</I>, the parent value is the minimum or maximum of all the child
values.
</P>
<P>The <I>cells</I> keyword determines how many new child cells are created
when a single grid cell is refined.  Nx by Ny by Nz new child cells
are created.  Nz must be 1 for 2d simulations.  In the future
we will allow for variable refinement by allowing wild cards
to be used for Nx, Ny, and Nz.
</P>
<P>The <I>region</I> keyword can be used to limit which grid cells are
eligible for adapation.  It applies to both child cells for refinment
and parent cells for coarsening.  The ID of the geometric region is
speficied as <I>regID</I>.  See the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command for
details on what kind of geometric regions can be defined.  Note that
the <I>side</I> option for the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command can be used to
define whether the inside or outside of the geometric region is
considered to be "in" the region.
</P>
<P>The grid cell must be in the region to be eligible for adaptation.
The <I>rflag</I> setting determines how a grid cell is judged to be in the
region or not.  For <I>rflag</I> = <I>one</I>, it is in the region if any of its
corner points (4 for 2d, 8 for 3d) is in the region.  For <I>rflag</I> =
<I>all</I>, all its corner points must be in the region.  For <I>rflag</I> =
<I>center</I>, the center point of the grid cell must be in the region.
</P>
<P>The <I>dir</I> keyword is only used by the style <I>surf</I>.  The Sx,Sy,Sz
settings are components of a vector.  It's length does not matter,
just its direction.  Only surface elements whose normal is opposed to
the vector direction (in a dot product sense) are eligible surfaces
for the adapation procedure described above for the <I>surf</I> style.
This can be useful to exclude refinement around surface elements that
are not facing "upwind" with respect to the flow direction of the
particles.  This is accomplished by setting Sx,Sy,Sz to the flow
direction.  If Sy,Sy,Sz = (0,0,0), which is the default, then no
surface elements are excluded.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> keyword triggers output of the adapted grid to the
specified <I>filename</I>.  The format of the file is the same as that
created by the <A HREF = "write_grid.html">write_grid</A> command, which is a list
of parent cells.  The file can be read in by a subsequent simulation
to define a grid, or used by visualization or other post-procesing
tools.
</P>
<P>If the filename contains a "*" wildcard character, then the "*" is
replaced by the current timestep.  This is useful for the <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix
adapt</A> command, if you wish to write out multiple grid
files.
</P>
<HR>

<P>If the grid is partitioned across processors in a "clumped" manner
before this command is invoked, it will still be clumped by processor
after the adaptation.  Likewise if it is not clumped before, it will
remain not clumped after adaptation.  You can use the
<A HREF = "balance_grid.html">balance_grid</A> command after this command to
re-balance the new adapted grid cells and their particles across
processors.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section howto 4.8</A> for a
description clumped and unclumped grids.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used after the grid has been created by the
<A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A>, <A HREF = "read_grid">read_grid</A>, or
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands.
</P>
<P>Currently a fix cannot be used with style <I>value</I> for <I>iterate</I> > 1.
This is because the per grid cell values accumulated by the fix will
need to be interpolated to new grid cells in order for the fix to be
evaluated multiple times.
