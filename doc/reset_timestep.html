<H3>reset_timestep command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>reset_timestep N 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = timestep number 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>reset_timestep 0
reset_timestep 4000000 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the timestep counter to the specified value.  This command
normally comes after the timestep has been set by reading a restart
file via the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command, or a previous
simulation advanced the timestep.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command sets the timestep to 0; the
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command sets the timestep to the
value it had when the restart file was written.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>This command cannot be used when any fixes are defined that keep track
of elapsed time to perform certain kinds of time-dependent operations.
Examples are the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A>, <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A>, and <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix ave/surf</A>
commands.  Thus these fixes should be specified after the timestep has
been reset.
</P>
<P>Resetting the timestep clears flags for <A HREF = "compute.html">computes</A> that
may have calculated some quantity from a previous run.  This means
these quantity cannot be accessed by a variable in between runs until
a new run is performed.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for
more details.
