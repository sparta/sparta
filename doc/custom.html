<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create or reset or remove a custom attribute for individual particles,
grid cells, or surface elements.  To create or reset an attribute a
variable is specified and evaluated.  Custom attributes can be can be
vectors (single value per entity) or arrays (mutiple values per
entity).  They can also be integer or floating point values.  See
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for more discussion of
custom attributes.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>style</I> setting is <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I>
for per-particle, per-grid, or per-surf attributes.
</P>
<P>The <I>custom-ID</I> specifies the attribute to operate on.  It begins with
a "p_" or "g_" or "s_" prefix for particles, grid cells, or surface
elements respectively and is followed by the name of the attribute.
The same name can be used for attributes of different styles, e.g.
s_temp and g_temp.
</P>
<P>The <I>action</I> is specified as <I>set</I> or <I>remove</I>.
</P>
<P>If <I>remove</I> is used, then the <I>custom-ID</I> is simply the name of the
attribute, whether it is a vector or array.  No trailing brackets are
specified.  The attribute will be removed from the system.  No further
arguments can be specified.
</P>
<P>If <I>set</I> is used, then the attribute is created if it does not already
exist and its values are initialized.  If it already exists, its
values are reset.  Custom attributes can be vectors (single value per
entity) or arrays (mutiple values per entity).  To set the values for
a custom vector, use a <I>custom-ID</I> without brackets, e.g. s_temp.  To
set the values for a single column of a custom array, use a
<I>custom-ID</I> suffixed by a bracketed integer, e.g. p_dipole<B>3</B>.  The
integer must be a value from 1 to M, where M is the number of columns
(values per entity) in the array.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>v_name</I> is the name of a previously defined variable
which this command will evaluate.  It must be either an equal-style or
particle-style or grid-style or surf-style variable.  All of these
styles define a mathematical formula which is used to compute the
value(s) of the variable.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> for
details.
</P>
<P>If an equal-style variable is specified, it produces a single value
which will be assigned as the custom value to all particles or grid
cells or surface elements.  Otherwise a particle-style variable must
be used for style = <I>particle</I>, a grid-style variable for style =
<I>grid</I>, or a surf-style variable for style = <I>surf</I>.  When it is
evaluated it generates one value for each particle, grid cell, or
surface element, which is assigned to the custom vector or to a column
of the custom array.
</P>
<P>Note that the latter 3 variable styles can include outputs from
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands.  They can also
include the spatial position of a particle, grid cell, or surface
element in their formula. So it is easy to calculate values for each
entity which vary spatially or which depend on the current timestep.
</P>
<P>The next two arguments, <I>subset-ID</I> and <I>region-ID</I>, can limit which
particles, grid cells, or surface elements are assigned a custom
value.  An individual particle, grid cell, or surface element must
meet both criteria to have its custom value set, otherwise its value
is set to zero.
</P>
<P>The <I>subset-ID</I> is the ID of a mixture for particles or the ID of a
group of grid cells or surface elements.  Only particles in the
mixture or grid cells/surface elements in the group will be assigned a
value.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> and <A HREF = "group.html">group</A> commands
for more details.  Note that "all" is a pre-defined mixture ID which
contains all particles.  Likewise "all" is the name of a pre-defined
group with all grid cells or surface elements.
</P>
<P>The <I>region-ID</I> is the ID of a geometric region defined by the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.  Only particles or grid cells or surface
elements in the region will have their values set.  The center point
of a grid cell or surface element is used for the region check.  If
<I>region-ID</I> is specified as NULL, then the region criterion is not
applied.
</P>
<P>Two optional keywords affect the creation of a new custom vector or
array.  The <I>type</I> keyword can be used with <I>int</I> or <I>float</I> as its
arg.  The created custom attribute will then store either integer or
floating-point values.  Floating point values are the default.
</P>
<P>The <I>size</I> keyword can be used with arg = 0 to create a custom vector
(which is the default).  It can also be used with an arg M >= 1 to
create an array with M columns.  This means that if a new <I>custom-ID</I>
is specified with no brackets, the <I>size</I> keyword is not necessary,
because it refers to a custom vector.  But if a new <I>custom-ID</I> with a
bracket is used, the <I>size</I> keyword must be used so that the column
dimension of the array is known.
