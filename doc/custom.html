<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create or remove or initialize/reset custom attributes for particles,
grid cells, or surface elements.
</P>
<P>To create a new attribute, the <I>create</I> action is specified.  To
remove an attribute, the <I>remove</I> action is specified.  The <I>set</I>
action evaluates a variable to reset the values for an attribute.  The
<I>file</I> action reads a file with lines starting with a grid cell ID or
surface element ID followed by values for one or more per-grid or
per-surf attributes.  Particle-style attributes cannot be reset with
the <I>file</I> action.
</P>
<P>Custom attributes can be vectors (single value per entity) or arrays
(mutiple values per entity).  They can also be integer or floating
point values.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_17">Section 6.17</A> for an
explanation of custom attributes.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> setting is <I>particle</I> or <I>grid</I> or <I>surf</I> for custom
per-particle, per-grid, or per-surf attributes.
</P>
<P>The <I>action</I> setting is <I>create</I> or <I>remove</I> or <I>set</I> or <I>file</I> or
<I>file/coarse</I>.
</P>
<P>The <I>create</I> action creates a new custom attribute called <I>cname</I> and
initializes all its values to zero.  The <I>datatype</I> is specified as
<I>int</I> or <I>float</I> and determines what kind of values the attribute
stores.  <I>Nc</I> is specified as 0 for custom vector which stores a
single value per entity.  Specify <I>Nc</I> >= 1 for a custom array which
stores Nc values per entity.
</P>
<P>The <I>remove</I> action deletes the custom attribute called <I>cname</I>,
whether it is a vector or array.
</P>
<P>The <I>set</I> and <I>file</I> and <I>file/coarse</I> actions reset the values of
custom attribute(s) which must already exist.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>set</I> action resets the values of a custom attribute by evaluating
a variable.  To operate on a custom vector, <I>cname</I> is simply the name
of the vector.  To operate on a single column of a custom array,
<I>cname</I> is specified as name[N] for the Nth column of a custom array
with name.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>v_name</I> is the name of the variable which is evaluated.
It must be either an equal-style or particle-style or grid-style or
surf-style variable.  All of these define a mathematical formula which
is used to compute the value(s) of the variable.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>If an equal-style variable is specified, it produces a single value
which will be assigned as the custom value to all the particles or
grid cells or surface elements (see subset-ID and region-ID discussion
below).  Otherwise a particle-style variable must be used for <I>style
particle</I>, a grid-style variable for <I>style grid</I>, or a surf-style
variable for <I>style surf</I>.  When it is evaluated it generates one
value for each particle, grid cell, or surface element, which is
assigned to the custom vector or to a column of the custom array.
</P>
<P>Note that the latter 3 variable styles can include outputs from
<A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> or <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands.  They can also
include the current timestep (as can equal-style variables) or the
spatial position of a particle, grid cell, or surface element in their
formula.  So it is easy to calculate a value for each entity which
varies in time or spatially.
</P>
<P>The next two arguments, <I>subset-ID</I> and <I>region-ID</I>, can limit which
particles, grid cells, or surface elements are assigned a custom
value.  An individual particle, grid cell, or surface element must
meet both criteria to have its custom value set, otherwise its value
is unchanged.
</P>
<P>The <I>subset-ID</I> is the ID of a mixture for particles or the ID of a
group of grid cells or surface elements.  Only particles in the
mixture or grid cells/surface elements in the group will be assigned a
value.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> and <A HREF = "group.html">group</A> commands
for more details.  Note that "all" is a pre-defined mixture ID which
contains all particles.  Likewise "all" is the name of a pre-defined
group with all grid cells or all surface elements.
</P>
<P>The <I>region-ID</I> is the ID of a geometric region defined by the
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command.  Only particles or grid cells or surface
elements in the region will have their values set.  The center point
of a grid cell or surface element is used for the region check.  If
<I>region-ID</I> is specified as NULL, then the region criterion is not
applied.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>file</I> action resets the values of one or more custom attributes
by reading them from the <I>fname</I> file.  It can only be used with
<I>style grid</I> or <I>style surf</I>, not with <I>style particle</I>.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>M</I> is the number of <I>cname1,cname2,...,cnameM</I> values
that follow and must match the number of values listed on each line in
the file, as explained below.  A <I>cnameI</I> with no brackets is the name
of a custom vector.  For a custom array, <I>cnameI</I> must be of the form
name[N] for the Nth column of the array.
</P>
<P>The format of the file is as follows.  Note that the number of grid
cells or surf elements specified in the file does not have to equal
the total number of grid cells or surface elements.  If the ID of a
grid cell or surface element does not appear in the file, then its
custom attribute value(s) will be unchanged.
</P>
<P>The file can start with any number of comment or blank lines.
A comment line starts with the "#" character.
</P>
<P>The first non-comment, non-blank line has this format:
</P>
<PRE>N Nvalue 
</PRE>
<P>N is the count of attribute value lines which follow.  These N lines
must immediately follow the count line and contain no blank lines.
Any remaining lines in the file are ignored.  Nvalue is the
number of attribute values per line and must equal the specified <I>M</I>.
</P>
<P>The format of each attribute value line is as follows:
</P>
<P>ID value1 value2 ... valueM
</P>
<P>ID is the integer ID of the grid cell or surface element.  Note that
for hierarchial grids, it must be the integer form of the ID, not the
string form (possibly with dashes).  M values follow, corresponding to
the <I>M</I> argument in the input script, following the <I>fname</I> argument.
</P>
<P>The following is an example of a correctly formatted file to set the
values for a per-surf custom array with 2 columns.  Only the values
for 3 surface elements are set.
</P>
<PRE># custom values for a few surface elements
# calculated for test problem XYZ 
</PRE>
<PRE>3 2
1 10.0 5.0
20 12.0 6.5
21 8.0 4.55 
</PRE>
<P>This file could be read with an input script command like this:
</P>
<PRE>custom surf create darray float 2 file file.surf 2 darray[1] darray[2] 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>The <I>file/coarse</I> action resets the values of one or more custom
attributes by reading coarse grid values from one or more files.  It
can only be used with <I>style grid</I>, not with <I>style surf</I> or <I>style
particle</I>.
</P>
<P>This action is designed to allow input of custom values for some
number of "coarse" grid cells.  The coarse cells and their values
could be output from another code, such as a continuum Navier-Stokes
(NS) code or even from an experiment.  The coarse cell values are
"mapped" to individual SPARTA grid cells, so that per-grid custom
attributes for each SPARTA grid cell are set by the values from one of
the coarse cells.  This is done in the following manner.
</P>
<P>Each coarse grid cell is associated with a (cx,cy,cz) point.  This
could be the center point of grid cell in a NS code which uses
finite-volume grid cells.  Or it could be a grid point in a NS code
which uses finite elements, e.g. the corner point of a triangle (2d)
or tetrahedron (3d).  Conceptually, the idea is that the small area
(2d) or volume (3d) surrounding the point has properties represented
by the coarse grid cell values in the file.
</P>
<P>All SPARTA grid cells define a center point (sx,sy,sz), which is the
center of a rectangle (2d) or parallelepiped (3d).
</P>
<P>Both the coarse-grid code and SPARTA should operate on the same
simulation domain, which is the simulation box in the case of SPARTA.
The set of all (cx,cy,cz) points should "cover" this domain, as do the
set of all (sx,sy,sz) points.  For each (sx,sz,sz) point, the
<I>nearest</I> (cx,cy,cz) point is found.  The coarse grid values for that
point are assigned to the custom per-grid values of that SPARTA grid
cell cell.  Here are a few additional details.
</P>
<UL><LI>If two or more coarse grid points are the "same" nearest distance from
a SPARTA center point, then their coarse grid values are averaged
before assigning them to the SPARTA grid cell.  Currently, "same" is
defined as within a distance cdist*(1+1.0e-6) where cdist = closest
distance from the SPARTA center point to any coarse grid
point. I.e. one part in a million. 

<LI>SPARTA center points will never be on the boundary of the simulation
domain.  But coarse grid points can be.  All coarse grid points must
be inside the SPARTA simulation box or on its surface. 

<LI>If surfaces are present in the two codes's simulations, then both
codes should define an identical set of surface elements.  This is
necessary to make flow parameters near surfaces consistent between the
two codes. 

<LI>SPARTA can define grid cells wholly inside of surface objects. The
coarse grid code may not, e.g. if finite elements conform to the
surface of an object.  The mapping operation described above is not
performed for SPARTA grid cells wholly inside surface objects; their
custom attribute values are set to zero.  If a SPARTA grid cell is cut
by surface elements, its center point may be inside a suface object.
In this case it should be fine to assign the grid cell values from the
nearest coarse grid point in the flow. 
</UL>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The current implementation of this "mapping" operation
stores the entire coarse grid on every processor, Each processor then
loops over the SPARTA grid cells it own and searches the entire set of
of coarse grid point for the nearest, using a k-d tree (in 2 or 3
dimensions).  If either the coarse grid storage or tree search becomes
a bottleneck for very large-scale problems, we could consider
implementing a more parallel algorithm.
</P>
<P>Creation of the file(s) read by this action is a pre-processing step.
The <A HREF = "create_particles.html">create_particles</A> command can be used with
its custom options to create particles with properties that match the
coarse-grid NS values read in and assigned to custom per-grid vectors
or arrays by this command.  Using this action with the <A HREF = "fix_custom.html">fix
custom</A> command could assign per-grid custom values
based on different time snapshots from the NS code.
</P>
<P>The <I>Nfile</I> argument is the number of files to read.  If <I>Nfile</I> > 1,
then the specified <I>fname</I> must contain a a wildcard "%" character
which is replaced by the numbers from 1 to Nfile to generate each
filename.  For example, if <I>Nfile</I> = 3 and <I>fname</I> is specified as
surf.%.attribute, then files surf.1.attribute, surf.2.attribute,
surf.3.attribute, etc will be read.  Note that if the <A HREF = "fix_custom.html">fix
custom</A> command uses this action, and there are also
multiple coarse files for different timesteps, then the specified
<I>fname</I> must contain both a wildcard "%" and "*" character.
</P>
<P>The reason to use multiple files is that a single file could be
extremely large and/or to enable more parallelism by having different
processors read different files simultaneously.  Conceptually, the
information being read is the union of the information from all the
individual files.  There must be no duplicate coarse grid points
(based on point coordinates) in a single or multiple files.
</P>
<P>The <I>filestyle</I> argument is <I>text</I> or <I>binary</I>.  The format for both
kinds of files is explained below.  NOTE: The binary format is not yet
supported by this command.
</P>
<P>The specified (M) number of <I>cname1,cname2,...,cnameM</I> arguments must
match the number of values listed on each line in each file.  A
<I>cnameI</I> with no brackets is the name of a custom vector.  For a
custom array, <I>cnameI</I> must be of the form cnameI[N] for the Nth
column of the array.
</P>
<P>For <I>filestyle</I> = <I>text</I>, the format of each file is as follows.  It
can start with any number of comment or blank lines.  A comment line
starts with the "#" character.  It is a good idea to document in a
comment what coarse grid values are listed on each line.
</P>
<P>The first non-comment, non-blank line has this format:
</P>
<PRE>N Nvalue 
</PRE>
<P>N is the count of coarse cell value lines which follow (in this file).
These N lines must immediately follow the count line and contain no
blank lines.  Any remaining lines in the file are ignored.  Nvalue is
the number of attribute values per line and must equal the specified
<I>M</I>.
</P>
<P>The format of each coarse cell value line is as follows:
</P>
<P>coarse-ID x y z value1 value2 ... valueM
</P>
<P>Coarse-ID is an integer ID of the coarse grid cell.  SPARTA ignores
this ID, but it may be convenient for indexing the coarse grid cells
from another code.  Or for indexing the coarse cells across multiple
coarse grid files.
</P>
<P>The x, y, z values are the coordinates of the coarse grid point
associated with the values which follow.  Z must be zero for a 2d or
axisymmetric simulation.
</P>
<P>M values follow, corresponding to the <I>M</I> argument in the input
script, following the <I>fname</I> argument.
</P>
<P>The following is an example of a correctly formatted file to set the
values for a per-grid custom array with 2 columns.
</P>

</PRE>
<P>The latter command assumes there are 2 other files like this one, with
names cfile.grid.1, cfile.grid.2, and cfile.grid.3.
</P>
<P>For <I>filestyle</I> = <I>binary</I>, the format of each file is as follows.
NOTE: The binary format is not yet supported by this command.
</P>
<PRE>Ncoarse (4-byte integer)
Nvalue (4-byte integer)
x y z (three 8-byte doubles for 1st coarse cell)

Nvalue custom values (Nvalue 8-byte doubles for 2nd cell)
...
x y z (three 8-byte doubles for Ncoarse cell)
Nvaluecustom values (Nvalue 8-byte doubles for Ncoarse cell) 
</PRE>
<P>Ncoarse is the number of coarse grid entries in this file.  Nvalue is
the number of values per coarse grid; it must match the specified <I>M</I>.
</P>
<P>X,y,z are the coordinates of the point associated with the values
which follow.
</P>
<P>Each of the Nvalue values are 8-byte floating point values (doubles).
If the corresponding custom attribute in SPARTA is of type <I>int</I>, then
the floating point value read from the file will be truncated to an
integer.  E.g. 12.0 --> 12, 12.3 --> 12.
</P>
