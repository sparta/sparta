react_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

react_modify keyword values ...  :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keywords = {recomb} or {rboost} :l
  {recomb} value = yes or no = enable or disable defined recombination reactions
  {rboost} value = rfactor
    rfactor = boost probability of recombination reactions by this factor :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

react_modify recomb no
react_modify rboost 100.0 :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters that affect how reactions are performed.

The {recomb} keyword turns on or off recombination reactions.  It is
only relevant if recombination reactions were defined in the reaction
file read in by the "react"_react.html command.  If the setting is
{no} then they will be disabled even if they were listed in the
reaction file.  This is useful to turn recombination reactions off to
see if they affect simulation results.

The {rboost} keyword does not affect the statistical properties of
recombination reactions, but tries to improve their computational
efficiency.  Recombination reactions typically occur with very low
probability, which means the code spends time testing for reactions
that rarely occur.  If the {rfactor} is set to N > 1, then
recombination reactions are skipped N-1 out of N times, when one or
more such reactions is defined for a pair of colliding particles.  A
random number us used to select on that probability.  To compensate,
when a recombination reaction is actually tested for occurrence, its
rate is boosted by a factor of N, making it N times more likely to
occur.

The smallest value {rboost} can be set to is 1.0, which effectively
applies no boost factor.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Setting {rboost} too large could meant the probability
of a recombination reaction becomes > 1.0, when it is does occur.
SPARTA does not check for this, so you should estimate the largest
boost factor that is safe to use for your model.
