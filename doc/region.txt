region command :h3

[Syntax:]

region ID style args keyword value ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the region :ulb,l
style = {block} or {cylinder} or {plane} or {sphere} or {union} or {intersect} :l
  {block} args = xlo xhi ylo yhi zlo zhi
    xlo,xhi,ylo,yhi,zlo,zhi = bounds of block in all dimensions (distance units)
  {cylinder} args = dim c1 c2 radius lo hi
    dim = {x} or {y} or {z} = axis of cylinder
    c1,c2 = coords of cylinder axis in other 2 dimensions (distance units)
    radius = cylinder radius (distance units)
    lo,hi = bounds of cylinder in dim (distance units)
  {plane} args = px py pz nx ny nz
    px,py,pz = point on the plane (distance units)
    nx,ny,nz = direction normal to plane (distance units)
  {sphere} args = x y z radius
    x,y,z = center of sphere (distance units)
    radius = radius of sphere (distance units)
  {union} args = N reg-ID1 reg-ID2 ...
    N = # of regions to follow, must be 2 or greater
    reg-ID1,reg-ID2, ... = IDs of regions to join together
  {intersect} args = N reg-ID1 reg-ID2 ...
    N = # of regions to follow, must be 2 or greater
    reg-ID1,reg-ID2, ... = IDs of regions to intersect :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {side} :l
  {side} value = {in} or {out}
    {in} = the region is inside the specified geometry
    {out} = the region is outside the specified geometry :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

region 1 block -3.0 5.0 INF 10.0 INF INF
region 2 sphere 0.0 0.0 0.0 5 side out
region void cylinder y 2 3 5 -5.0 INF
region outside union 4 side1 side2 side3 side4 :pre

[Description:]

This command defines a geometric region of space.  Various other
commands use regions.  See the "group grid"_group.html, "group
surf"_group.html, and "dump_modify"_dump_modify.html commands for
examples.

Commands which use regions typically test whether a point is contained
in the region or not.  For this purpose, coordinates exactly on the
region boundary are considered to be interior to the region.  This
means, for example, for a spherical region, a point on the sphere
surface would be part of the region if the sphere were defined with
the {side in} keyword, but would not be part of the region if it were
defined using the {side out} keyword.  See more details on the {side}
keyword below.

The lo/hi values for the {block} or {cylinder} styles can be specified
as INF which means a large negative or positive number (1.0e20).

For style {cylinder}, the c1,c2 params are coordinates in the 2 other
dimensions besides the cylinder axis dimension.  For dim = x, c1/c2 =
y/z; for dim = y, c1/c2 = x/z; for dim = z, c1/c2 = x/y.  Thus the
third example above specifies a cylinder with its axis in the
y-direction located at x = 2.0 and z = 3.0, with a radius of 5.0, and
extending in the y-direction from -5.0 to infinity.

The {union} style creates a region consisting of the volume of all the
listed regions combined.  The {intersect} style creates a region
consisting of the volume that is common to all the listed regions.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Regions in SPARTA are always 3d geometric objects,
regardless of whether the "dimension"_dimension.html of the simulation
2d or 3d.  Thus when using regions in a 2d simulation, for example,
you should be careful to define the region so that its intersection
with the 2d x-y plane of the simulation has the 2d geometric extent
you want.

The {side} keyword determines whether the region is considered to be
inside or outside of the specified geometry.  Using this keyword in
conjunction with {union} and {intersect} regions, complex geometries
can be built up.  For example, if the interior of two spheres were
each defined as regions, and a {union} style with {side} = out was
constructed listing the region-IDs of the 2 spheres, the resulting
region would be all the volume in the simulation box that was outside
both of the spheres.
